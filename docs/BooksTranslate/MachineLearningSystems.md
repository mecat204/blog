  - Machine Learning Systems provides a systematic framework for understanding and engineering machine learning (ML) systems. This textbook bridges the gap between theoretical foundations and practical engineering, emphasizing the systems perspective required to build effective AI solutions. Unlike resources that focus primarily on algorithms and model architectures, this book highlights the broader context in which ML systems operate, including data engineering, model optimization, hardware-aware training, and inference acceleration. Readers will develop the ability to reason about ML system architectures and apply enduring engineering principles for building flexible, efficient, and robust machine learning systems.

  - Why We Wrote This Book
  - 我们为何写这本书

  ---
  - The Problem: Students learn to train AI models, but few understand how to build the systems that actually make them work in production. When ML systems concepts are taught, students often learn individual components without grasping the holistic architecture—they can see the trees but miss the forest.
  - 问题是：学生们学习如何训练人工智能模型，但很少有人真正理解如何构建那些能让它们在生产环境中发挥作用的系统。当学习机器学习系统概念时，学生常常只学习单个组件，却未能掌握整体结构——他们能看到树木，却忽略了森林。

  ---
  - The Future: As AI becomes more autonomous, the bottleneck won’t be just the algorithms—it will be the AI engineers who can build efficient, scalable, and sustainable systems.
  - 未来：随着人工智能变得更加自主，瓶颈将不仅仅是算法——而是能够构建高效、可扩展且可持续系统的人工智能工程师。

  ---
  - Our Approach: This vision emerged from collaborative work in CS249r at Harvard University, where students, faculty, and industry partners came together to explore the systems side of ML. The content was developed through real student contributions during Fall 2023. What started as class notes has turned into a comprehensive educational resource we now share globally.
  - 我们的方法：这一愿景源自哈佛大学CS249r的合作工作，学生、教师和行业合作伙伴共同探讨机器学习的系统方面。内容由真实学生于2023年秋季贡献而成。最初的课堂笔记，如今发展成为我们全球共享的综合教育资源。

  - AI is bound to transform the world in profound ways, much like computers and the Internet revolutionized every aspect of society in the 20th century. From systems that generate creative content like text and images to those driving breakthroughs in drug discovery and scientific research, AI is ushering in a new era—one that promises to be even more transformative in its scope and impact. But how do we make it accessible to everyone?
  - 人工智能必将以深刻的方式改变世界，就像20世纪计算机和互联网彻底改变社会各方面一样。从生成文本和图片等创意内容的系统，到推动药物发现和科学研究突破的系统，人工智能正开启一个新纪元——一个在范围和影响力上将更具变革性的时代。但我们如何让所有人都能接触到它呢？

  ---
  - With its transformative power comes an equally great responsibility for those who access it or work with it. Just as we expect companies to wield their influence ethically, those of us in academia bear a parallel responsibility: to share our knowledge openly, so it benefits everyone—not just a select few. This conviction inspired the creation of this book—an open-source resource aimed at making AI education, particularly in AI engineering and systems, inclusive, and accessible to everyone from all walks of life.
  - 随着其变革力量的存在，所有接触或与之合作的人也肩负着同样巨大的责任。正如我们期望企业以道德方式行使影响力一样，我们学术界也有同样的责任：公开分享我们的知识，让所有人受益——而不仅仅是少数人。这种信念激发了这本书的创作——一本开源资源，旨在让人工智能教育，特别是人工智能工程和系统领域，变得包容且对各行各业的人开放。

  - My passion for creating, curating, and editing this content has been deeply influenced by landmark textbooks that have profoundly shaped both my academic and personal journey. Whether I studied them cover to cover or drew insights from key passages, these resources fundamentally shaped the way I think. I reflect on the books that guided my path: works by Turing Award winners such as David Patterson and John Hennessy—pioneers in computer architecture and system design—and foundational research papers by luminaries like Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio, who pioneered modern deep learning. In some small part, my hope is that this book will inspire students to chart their own unique paths.

  - 计算机科学学生：机器学习系统将熟悉的概念扩展到新的领域。如果你接触过算法和数据结构，可以把机器学习看作是基于数据模式自动优化的学习算法，而不是遵循固定指令。

  ---
  - Your experience with system design, memory management, parallel processing, and distributed systems directly applies to ML deployment. The underlying computational complexity analysis still applies—we analyze time and space complexity for training and inference phases separately.
  - 你在系统设计、内存管理、并行处理和分布式系统的经验直接适用于机器学习部署。底层的计算复杂性分析依然适用——我们分别分析训练和推理阶段的时间和空间复杂度。

  - This book began as a community-driven project shaped by the collective efforts of students in CS249r, colleagues at Harvard and beyond, and the broader ML systems community. Its content has evolved through open collaboration, thoughtful feedback, and modern editing tools—including both rule-based scripts and generative AI technologies. In a fitting twist, the very systems we study in this book have helped refine its pages, highlighting the interplay between human expertise and machine intelligence. Fortunately, they’re not quite ready to engineer the systems themselves—at least, not yet.
  - 这本书最初是一个由CS249r学生、哈佛及其他大学同事以及更广泛机器学习系统社区共同努力塑造的社区驱动项目。其内容通过开放协作、深思熟虑的反馈和现代编辑工具不断发展——包括基于规则的脚本和生成式人工智能技术。有趣的是，我们在本书研究的系统反而帮助完善了本书的篇章，突出了人类专业知识与机器智能之间的相互作用。幸运的是，他们还没准备好自己设计这些系统——至少现在还没有。
