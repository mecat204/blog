  - At five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car out and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His back and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and wheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done okay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he liked the idea of repairing the foundations himself.
  - 五点钟，埃德·洛伊斯洗漱完毕，戴上帽子和外套，开车穿过城镇，前往他的电视销售店。他累了。他的背和肩膀因为从地下室挖土推到后院而酸痛。但对于一个四十岁的男人来说，他表现还算不错。珍妮特可以用他攒下的钱买一个新花瓶;而且他喜欢自己修复地基的想法。

  - It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying commuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and packages, students, swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks and businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him; he'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamppost.
  - 天色渐暗。落日洒下长长的阳光，洒在匆忙的通勤者身上，疲惫而面色凝重，背负着包裹和包裹的妇女们，学生们从大学蜂拥而至，与职员、商人和沉闷的秘书混在一起。他停下帕卡德等红灯，然后又发动了。店铺在没有他的情况下还开着;他会及时赶到，给帮手咒语叫晚餐，查看当天的记录，甚至可能亲自完成几笔交易。他慢慢开车经过街道中央那片小小的绿地——镇上的公园。LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE 门口没有停车位。他低声咒骂，转身掉头。他再次经过那片绿地，那里有孤零零的饮水喷泉、长椅和一根路灯。

  ---
  - From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square.
  - 路灯杆上挂着什么东西。一个无形的黑暗包裹，随风轻轻摆动。就像个假人。洛伊斯摇下车窗，往外看。到底是什么？某种展示？有时商会会在广场上布置展览。

  ---
  - Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.
  - 他又掉头，把车开了过来。他经过公园，专注于那个黑暗的包裹。那不是假人。如果说是展示，那也是一种奇怪的展示。脖子上的毛竖起，他不安地咽了口口水。汗水滑落在他的脸和手上。

  ---
  - It was a body. A human body.
  - 那是一具尸体。一具人体。

  ---
  - "Look at it!" Loyce snapped. "Come on out here!"
  - "看看它！"洛伊斯厉声说道。"出来吧！"

  ---
  - Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. "This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there."
  - 唐·弗格森慢慢地走出店里，端庄地扣上条纹外套的扣子。"这很重要，埃德。我不能就这么让那家伙站在那里。"

  ---
  - "See it?" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the sky—the post and the bundle swinging from it. "There it is. How the hell long has it been there?" His voice rose excitedly. "What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!"
  - "看到了吗？"埃德指向渐渐聚集的昏暗。路灯柱顶向天空——灯柱和那个包裹从上面荡来荡去。"就是那里。它到底放了多久？"他的声音兴奋地提高了。"大家怎么了？他们就这样走过去！"

  ---
  - Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. "Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there."
  - 唐·弗格森慢慢点燃了一支烟。"别激动，老头。一定有充分的理由，否则就不会有。"

  ---
  - "A reason! What kind of a reason?"
  - "理由！什么理由？"

  ---
  - Fergusson shrugged. "Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?"
  - 弗格森耸耸肩。"就像交通安全委员会把那辆报废的别克放在那里一样。某种市政活动。我怎么会知道？"

  ---
  - Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. "What's up, boys?"
  - 鞋店的杰克·波特加入了他们。"怎么了，伙计们？"

  ---
  - "There's a body hanging from the lamppost," Loyce said. "I'm going to call the cops."
  - "路灯杆上挂着一具尸体，"洛伊斯说。"我要报警了。"

  ---
  - "They must know about it," Potter said. "Or otherwise it wouldn't be there."
  - "他们一定知道这件事，"波特说。"否则它就不会存在。"

  ---
  - "I got to get back in." Fergusson headed back into the store. "Business before pleasure."
  - "我得回去了。"弗格森回到了店里。"公事重于享乐。"

  ---
  - Loyce began to get hysterical. "You see it? You see it hanging there? A man's body! A dead man!" "Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee."
  - 洛伊斯开始歇斯底里。"你看见了吗？你看到它挂在那里了吗？一具男人的身体！一个死人！""当然，埃德。我今天下午出去喝咖啡时看到的。"

  ---
  - "You mean it's been there all afternoon?"
  - "你是说它整个下午都在那里？"

  ---
  - "Sure. What's the matter?" Potter glanced at his watch. "Have to run. See you later, Ed."
  - "当然。怎么了？"波特看了看手表。"得走了。回头见，埃德。"

  ---
  - Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundle—and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention.
  - 波特匆匆离开，加入了人行道上人流。男女经过公园。有几个人好奇地抬头看了看那个黑色包裹——然后继续说。没人停下来。没人注意。

  ---
  - "I'm going nuts," Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him. He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.
  - "我快疯了，"洛伊斯低声说。他走到路边，穿过车流，穿过车流，穿梭在车流中。喇叭愤怒地对他鸣响。他走上路缘，踏上那片绿色的小方块。

  ---
  - The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never seen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned away, and in the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His eyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.
  - 那人已经中年了。他的衣服破烂不堪，是一套灰色西装，满是干涸的泥巴和泥巴。一个陌生人。洛伊斯以前从未见过他。不是本地人。他的脸半转过身，晚风中他轻轻转身，默默无声地转了个身。他的皮肤被挖伤和割伤。红色的伤口，凝结的血迹深深划痕。一副钢框眼镜从一只耳朵上挂着，笨拙地垂着。他的眼睛瞪得大大的。他的嘴张开，舌头粗糙且丑陋的蓝色。

  ---
  - "For Heaven's sake," Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with revulsion—and fear.
  - "看在上帝的份上，"洛伊斯低声嘟囔，感到恶心。他压下恶心，走回人行道。他浑身颤抖，充满厌恶和恐惧。

  ---
  - Why? Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?
  - 为什么？那个人是谁？他为什么挂在那里？这意味着什么？

  ---
  - And—why didn't anybody notice?
  - 而且——为什么没人注意到？

  ---
  - He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. "Watch it!" the man grated. "Oh, it's you, Ed."
  - 他撞上了一个匆匆走在人行道上的小个子男人。"小心点！"那人咬牙切齿地说。"哦，是你啊，艾德。"

  ---
  - Ed nodded dazedly. "Hello, Jenkins."
  - 埃德迷迷糊糊地点了点头。"你好，詹金斯。"

  ---
  - "What's the matter?" The stationery clerk caught Ed's aim "You look sick."
  - "怎么了？"文具店员抓住了埃德的目光，"你看起来病了。"

  ---
  - "The body. There in the park."
  - "尸体。就在公园里。"

  ---
  - "Sure, Ed." Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. "Take it easy."
  - "当然，埃德。"詹金斯带他进入了洛伊斯电视销售与服务部的角落。"别激动。"

  ---
  - Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. "Something wrong?"
  - 珠宝店的玛格丽特·亨德森加入了他们。"有什么不对劲吗？"

  ---
  - "Ed's not feeling well."
  - "埃德身体不舒服。"

  ---
  - Loyce yanked himself free. "How can you stand here? Don't you see it? For God's sake—" "What's he talking about?" Margaret asked nervously.
  - 洛伊斯挣脱了出来。"你怎么能站在这里？你没看出来吗？看在上帝的份上——" "他在说什么？"玛格丽特紧张地问。

  ---
  - "The body!" Ed shouted. "The body hanging there!"
  - "尸体！"埃德喊道。"那具尸体挂在那里！"

  ---
  - More people collected. "Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?"
  - 更多人聚集。"他生病了吗？是埃德·洛伊斯。你还好吗，埃德？"

  ---
  - "The body!" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at him. He tore loose. "Let me go! The police! Get the police!"
  - "尸体！"洛伊斯尖叫着，挣扎着想从他们身边突破。手抓住了他。他挣脱了。"放开我！警察！快叫警察！"

  ---
  - "Ed—"
  - "艾德——"

  ---
  - "Better get a doctor!"
  - "最好去找医生！"

  ---
  - "He must be sick."
  - "他一定是生病了。"

  ---
  - "Or drunk."
  - "或者喝醉了。"

  ---
  - Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell. Through a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man, showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service counter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically. His voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmuring around him.
  - 洛伊斯在人群中奋力杀出重围。他踉跄了一下，半摔了一跤。透过一团模糊，他看到一排排面孔，好奇、担忧、焦虑。男女停下脚步，想看看发生了什么骚动。他冲过他们，朝自己的店铺走去。他看到弗格森在屋里和一个人说话，给他看一台埃默森电视。皮特·福利在后排服务柜台，准备新的菲尔科。洛伊斯慌乱地喊着。他的声音被车流的轰鸣和周围的低语淹没。

  ---
  - "Do something!" he screamed. "Don't stand there! Do something! Something's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!" The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving efficiently toward Loyce.
  - "做点什么！"他大喊。"别站在那里！做点什么！有问题！出事了！事情正在发生！"人群为这两名身材魁梧的警察高效地朝洛伊斯走来感到敬意。

  ---
  - "Name?" the cop with the notebook murmured.
  - "名字？"拿着笔记本的警察低声问。

  ---
  - "Loyce." He mopped his forehead wearily. "Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me. Back there—"
  - "洛伊斯。"他疲惫地擦了擦额头。"爱德华·C·洛伊斯。听我说。刚才——"

  ---
  - "Address?" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through traffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the seat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.
  - "地址？"警察质问。警车迅速穿过车流，在车辆和公交车间开枪。洛伊斯瘫坐在座位上，疲惫又困惑。他深深吸了一口气，颤抖着。

  ---
  - "1368 Hurst Road."
  - "赫斯特路1368号。"

  ---
  - "That's here in Pikeville?"
  - "那是在派克维尔？"

  ---
  - "That's right." Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. "Listen to me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost—"
  - "没错。"洛伊斯用力拉起自己。"听我说。就在那儿。在广场上。挂在路灯杆上——"

  ---
  - "Where were you today?" the cop behind the wheel demanded.
  - "你今天去哪儿了？"驾驶员质问。

  ---
  - "Where?" Loyce echoed.
  - "去哪儿？"洛伊斯重复道。

  ---
  - "You weren't in your shop, were you?"
  - "你不在店里吧？"

  ---
  - "No." He shook his head. "No, I was home. Down in the basement."
  - "不。"他摇了摇头。"不，我当时在家。在地下室。"

  ---
  - "In the basement?"
  - "在地下室？"

  ---
  - "Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame. Why? What has that to do with—"
  - "挖。一个新的基础。把泥土挖出来浇筑水泥框架。为什么？这和——有什么关系？"

  ---
  - "Was anybody else down there with you?"
  - "还有别人和你一起在下面吗？"

  ---
  - "No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school." Loyce looked from one heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flickered across his face, wild hope. "You mean because I was down there I missed—the explanation? I didn't get in on it? Like everybody else?" After a pause the cop with the notebook said: "That's right. You missed the explanation."
  - "不。我妻子当时在市中心。我孩子们都在学校。"洛伊斯从一个身材魁梧的警察看向另一个。希望在他脸上闪过，狂野的希望。"你的意思是因为我在那里，我错过了——解释？我没参与？像其他人一样？"停顿后，拿着笔记本的警察说："没错。你错过了解释。"

  ---
  - "Then it's official? The body—it's supposed to be hanging there?"
  - "那就正式了？尸体——应该挂在那里？"

  ---
  - "It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see."
  - "它本该挂在那里。让所有人都看见。"

  ---
  - Ed Loyce grinned weakly. "Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep end. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like the Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking over." He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands shaking. "I'm glad to know it's on the level."
  - 埃德·洛伊斯虚弱地笑了笑。"天哪。我想我有点失控了。我以为可能发生了什么事。你知道的，类似三K党那样的组织。某种暴力。共产主义者或法西斯接管。"他用胸前口袋的手帕擦了擦脸，手在颤抖。"很高兴知道你说的是真的。"

  ---
  - "It's on the level." The police car was getting near the Hall of Justice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights had not yet come on.
  - "这是真的。"警车快到司法大厅了。太阳已经落山。街道阴沉黑暗。灯还没亮。

  ---
  - "I feel better," Loyce said. "I was pretty excited there, for a minute. I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to take me in, is there?"
  - "我感觉好多了，"洛伊斯说。"我刚才还挺兴奋的，刚才有那么一会儿。我想我被激动了。既然我明白了，没必要收留我，对吧？"

  ---
  - The two cops said nothing.
  - 两名警察一言不发。

  ---
  - "I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all right, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of—" "This won't take long," the cop behind the wheel interrupted. "A short process. Only a few minutes."
  - "我应该回我的店了。男孩们还没吃晚饭呢。我现在没事了。不再麻烦了。需要——""这不会花太久时间，"驾驶员打断了他。"过程很短。只有几分钟。"

  ---
  - "I hope it's short," Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a stoplight. "I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting excited like that and—"
  - "希望它能短一点，"洛伊斯嘟囔道。车子减速等红绿灯。"我想我有点打扰了安宁。真有趣，居然这么激动——"

  ---
  - Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled to his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light changed. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people, burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, snouts, people running.
  - 洛伊斯猛地拉开门。他摊开在街上，滚了起来。周围的汽车不断移动，随着红灯变换加速。洛伊斯跳上人行道，在人群中奔跑，钻进人群中。身后传来声音，鼻子声，有人奔跑。

  ---
  - They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in Pikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small town for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.
  - 他们不是警察。他立刻意识到了这一点。他认识派克维尔的每一个警察。一个男人不可能在一个小镇上开店、经营生意二十五年而不认识所有警察。

  ---
  - They weren't cops—and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter, Fergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't know—and they didn't care. That was the strange part.
  - 他们不是警察——也没有任何解释。波特、弗格森、詹金斯，他们都不知道为什么会在那里。他们不知道——也不在乎。这就是奇怪的地方。

  ---
  - Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the startled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the back door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete steps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side, gasping and panting.
  - 洛伊斯躲进了一家五金店。他冲向后面，越过惊讶的店员和顾客，进入发货室，穿过后门。他绊倒在一个垃圾桶上，跑上了一段混凝土台阶。他翻过篱笆，跳到另一边，喘着气。

  ---
  - There was no sound behind him. He had got away.
  - 身后没有任何声音。他逃脱了。

  ---
  - He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and ruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street light wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.
  - 他站在一条小巷的入口，黑暗中散落着木板、破损的箱子和轮胎。他能看到远处的街道。一盏路灯摇晃着亮了起来。男人和女人。商店。霓虹灯。汽车。

  ---
  - And to his right—the police station.
  - 右边是警察局。

  ---
  - He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery store rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred windows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the darkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to keep moving, get farther away from them.
  - 他很接近，非常接近。穿过一家杂货店的装卸平台，是司法大厅白色混凝土的一侧。有铁栏窗。警察天线。一堵巨大的混凝土墙在黑暗中升起。对他来说是个糟糕的地方。他离得太近了。他必须继续前进，离他们更远。

  ---
  - Them?
  - 他们？

  ---
  - Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the City Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass and broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark windows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.
  - 洛伊斯小心翼翼地沿着小巷走去。警察局外是市政厅，那是一座老式的黄色建筑，由木质、镀金黄铜和宽阔的水泥台阶组成。他能看到无尽的办公室排队、黑色的窗户、入口两侧的雪松和花坛。

  ---
  - And—something else.
  - 还有——还有别的东西。

  ---
  - Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost into the sky.
  - 市政厅上方是一片黑暗，阴郁的锥形比周围的夜晚还要浓密。一道黑色棱镜扩散开来，消失在天空中。

  ---
  - He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him struggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound. A buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.
  - 他倾听着。天哪，他能听到什么声音。让他拼命想闭上耳朵、闭上心灵，把声音隔绝。嗡嗡声。远处传来一阵低沉的嗡鸣，像一大群蜜蜂。

  ---
  - Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over the City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid. In the vortex something moved. Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky, pausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense swarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.
  - 洛伊斯惊恐地抬头，僵硬地盯着。那片黑暗的斑点，悬挂在市政厅上空。黑暗厚重得几乎像实体一样。在漩涡中，有什么东西动了。闪烁的形状。物体从天而降，在市政厅上空短暂停留，密集地飞过，然后无声地落在屋顶上。

  ---
  - Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that hung above him. He was seeing—them.
  - 形状。天空中飘落的身影。从头顶那道黑暗的裂缝中。他看见了——他们。

  ---
  - For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool of scummy water.
  - 洛伊斯蹲在一堵下陷的围栏后，浸泡在污浊的水池中，观察了很久。

  ---
  - They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the City Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of some kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest—and then crawled crab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.
  - 他们正在降落。他们成群结队地降落，落在市政厅屋顶，然后消失在里面。他们有翅膀。像某种巨型昆虫。它们飞翔、扑腾，停下——然后像螃蟹一样侧身爬过屋顶，进入建筑物。

  ---
  - He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he shuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the City Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of the building and halting for a moment before going on.
  - 他感到恶心。而且很着迷。冷冽的夜风在他周围吹来，他不禁打了个寒颤。他疲惫不堪，震惊得头晕目眩。市政厅前台阶上，站着一些男人。一群群男人从建筑里走出来，停顿片刻后继续前行。

  ---
  - Were there more of them?
  - 他们还有更多吗？

  ---
  - It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm weren't men. They were alien—from some other world, some other dimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the universe. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm of being.
  - 这似乎不可能。他看到从黑暗深渊中降下的不是人类。他们是异星人——来自另一个世界，另一个维度。滑过这道裂缝，穿过宇宙壳的裂缝。从这个缝隙进入，来自另一个存在领域的有翼昆虫。

  ---
  - On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved toward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter the City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.
  - 在市政厅台阶上，一群男子散开了。有几个人朝一辆等候的车走去。剩下的其中一个身影开始重新进入市政厅。它改变主意，转身跟随其他人。

  ---
  - Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight, clutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly fluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and came to rest among them.
  - 洛伊斯惊恐地闭上了眼睛。他的感官一阵混乱。他紧紧抓住下垂的围栏。那个人形的形态突然扑腾起来，跟着其他的飞扑翅膀。它飞到人行道上，停在他们中间。

  ---
  - Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves as men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration. Mimicry.
  - 伪男人。模仿者。昆虫能伪装成人类。就像地球上其他熟悉的昆虫一样。保护色素。模仿。

  ---
  - Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The alley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe darkness made no difference to them.
  - 洛伊斯挣脱了距离。他慢慢站起身。那是夜晚。巷子里一片漆黑。但也许他们能在黑暗中看见。也许黑暗对他们毫无影响。

  ---
  - He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and women flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus stops stood waiting groups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the evening gloom.
  - 他小心翼翼地离开小巷，走到街上。男女陆续涌过，但现在已经不多了。公交车站处站着等待的队伍。一辆巨大的公交车缓缓驶过街道，灯光在暮色中闪烁。

  ---
  - Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the bus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A moment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.
  - 洛伊斯继续前进。他挤过等候的人群，等公交车停下后，他上了车，坐在后排，靠门的位置。片刻后，公交车启动，隆隆地沿着街道驶下。

  ---
  - Loyce relaxed a little. He studied the people around him. Dulled, tired faces. People going home from work. Quite ordinary faces. None of them paid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats, jiggling with the motion of the bus. The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the sports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A businessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family.
  - 洛伊斯稍微放松了一些。他观察着周围的人。暗淡、疲惫的脸庞。有人下班回家。相当普通的面孔。他们都没理会他。所有人都安静地坐着，坐在座位上，随着公交车的晃动晃动。坐在他旁边的男人展开了一份报纸。他开始阅读体育版块，嘴唇微微动着。一个普通人。蓝色西装。领带。商人，或者推销员。他正回家，和妻子家人在一起。

  ---
  - Across the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty. Dark eyes and hair, a package on her lap. Nylons and heels. Red coat and white Angora sweater. Gazing absently ahead of her.
  - 过道对面坐着一位大约二十岁的年轻女子。深邃的眼睛和头发，膝上放着一个包裹。丝袜和高跟鞋。红色外套和白色安哥拉毛衣。心不在焉地望着前方。

  ---
  - A high school boy in jeans and black jacket.
  - 一个穿牛仔裤和黑色夹克的高中男孩。

  ---
  - A great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with packages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness. Ordinary people. The kind that rode the bus every evening. Going home to their families. To dinner.
  - 一个三下巴的漂亮女人，背着装满包裹和包裹的大购物袋。她厚实的脸因疲惫而黯淡。普通人。那种每天晚上都坐公交车的人。回家见家人。去吃晚饭。

  - Going home—with their minds dead. Controlled, filmed over with the mask of an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them, their town, their lives. Himself, too. Except that he happened to be deep in his cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked. They had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect, foolproof.
  - 回家——心智已死。被控制，被一个外星生物的面具覆盖，这个存在出现并占据了他们、他们的小镇和生命。他自己也是。只是他恰好在地窖深处，而不是在商店里。不知怎的，他被忽视了。他们很想念他。他们的控制并不完美，也不是万无一失。

  ---
  - Maybe there were others.
  - 也许还有其他人。

  ---
  - Hope flickered in Loyce. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a mistake, not got control of him. Their net, their field of control, had passed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down. Apparently their power-zone was limited. A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loyce broke off his chain of thought. A slender man, with dark hair and a small mustache. Well-dressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small hands. He was watching Loyce, studying him intently. He turned quickly away.
  - 洛伊斯心中闪现出一丝希望。他们并非全能。他们犯了错，没有控制他。他们的网，他们的控制场，已经越过了他。他从地窖出来，正好下去。显然他们的权力范围有限。过道几排外，有个男人在看他。洛伊斯打断了思绪。一个身材瘦削、黑发、留着小胡子的男人。穿着讲究，棕色西装，鞋子闪亮。小手中夹着一本书。他注视着洛伊斯，专注地打量着他。他迅速转身离开。

  ---
  - Loyce tensed. One of them? Or—another they had missed?
  - 洛伊斯紧张起来。其中一个？或者——又是他们错过的？

  ---
  - The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever. Shrewd. A man too shrewd for them—or one of the things itself, an alien insect from beyond.
  - 那人又在看他。小巧的黑眼睛，生机勃勃，聪明。精明。一个比他们更精明的人——或者是某种东西本身，一个来自彼岸的外星昆虫。

  ---
  - The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into the box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce.
  - 公交车停了下来。一位老人慢慢上车，把他的代币放进了箱子里。他走过过道，坐在洛伊斯对面。

  ---
  - The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second something passed between them. A look rich with meaning.
  - 老人捕捉到了这位锐利眼神的目光。一瞬间，他们之间闪过一丝什么。那是一种充满意义的目光。

  ---
  - Loyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step down into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber door swung open.
  - 洛伊斯站了起来。公交车在动。他跑向门口。往井里走一步。他猛地拉开紧急门的释放按钮。橡胶门被推开了。

  ---
  - "Hey!" the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. "What the hell—?"
  - "喂！"司机喊道，猛踩刹车。"这到底是怎么回事——？"

  ---
  - Loyce squirmed through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A residential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings. Behind him, the bright-eyed man had leaped up. The elderly man was also on his feet. They were coming after him. Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid down again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off.
  - 洛伊斯挤过去。公交车开始减速。四周都是房屋。一个住宅区，草坪和高层公寓楼。他身后，那个眼睛明亮的男人跳了起来。老人也站了起来。他们正在追捕他。洛伊斯跳了起来。他用极大的力量撞击地面，滚到了路缘边。疼痛袭来。痛苦和一片黑暗的潮水。他拼命抵抗。他挣扎着跪起，然后又滑了下去。公交车停了下来。人们下车了。

  ---
  - Loyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in the gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed before him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book.
  - 洛伊斯摸索着。他的手指握住了什么东西。一块石头，躺在沟里。他爬起身，痛苦地咕哝着。一个身影在他面前显现。一个男人，那个眼睛明亮、拿着书的男人。

  ---
  - Loyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The man screamed and tried to roll away. "Stop! For God's sake listen—"
  - 洛伊斯踢了一脚。那人倒吸一口气，跌倒了。洛伊斯把石头放下了。那人尖叫着试图翻滚逃跑。"停下！看在上帝的份上，听我说——"

  ---
  - He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others were there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk, up a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were bending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed man who had come after him.
  - 他又出手了。一声可怕的碎裂声。那人的声音戛然而止，化为一声翻腾的哀号。洛伊斯慌忙爬上又回来。其他人现在都在那里。四周都是。他笨拙地沿着人行道跑上车道。他们都没跟上他。他们停下，弯腰看着那个拿着书的男人的无力身体，那个眼睛明亮的男人，跟着他走来。

  ---
  - Had he made a mistake?
  - 他是不是犯了错？

  ---
  - But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out—away from them. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between their world and his.
  - 但现在担心这些已经太晚了。他必须离开——远离他们。离开派克维尔，穿越黑暗的裂缝，那是他们世界与他世界之间的裂缝。

  ---
  - "Ed!" Janet Loyce backed away nervously. "What is it? What—"
  - "艾德！"珍妮特·洛伊斯紧张地后退。"怎么了？什么——"

  ---
  - Ed Loyce slammed the door behind him and came into the living room. "Pull down the shades. Quick." Janet moved toward the window. "But—"
  - 埃德·洛伊斯砰地关上门，走进客厅。"拉下窗帘。快点。"珍妮特走向窗户。"但是——"

  ---
  - "Do as I say. Who else is here besides you?"
  - "照我说的做。除了你，还有谁？"

  ---
  - "Nobody. Just the twins. They're upstairs in their room. What's happened? You look so strange. Why are you home?"
  - "没人。只有双胞胎。他们在楼上的房间里。发生了什么？你看起来真奇怪。你怎么回来了？"

  ---
  - Ed locked the front door. He prowled around the house, into the kitchen. From the drawer under the sink he slid out the big butcher knife and ran his finger along it. Sharp. Plenty sharp. He returned to the living room.
  - 埃德锁上了前门。他在屋子里徘徊，进了厨房。他从水槽下的抽屉里抽出一把大屠刀，用手指划过。锐利。非常锋利。他回到客厅。

  ---
  - "Listen to me," he said. "I don't have much time. They know I escaped and they'll be looking for me."
  - "听我说，"他说。"我没多少时间了。他们知道我逃出来了，会一直找我。"

  ---
  - "Escaped?" Janet's face twisted with bewilderment and fear. "Who?"
  - "逃跑了？"珍妮特的脸上满是困惑和恐惧。"谁？"

  ---
  - "The town has been taken over. They're in control. I've got it pretty well figured out. They started at the top, at the City Hall and police department. What they did with the real humans they—"
  - "镇子被占领了。他们掌控一切。我已经很清楚了。他们从市政厅和警察局的顶层开始。他们对真正的人类做了什么——"

  ---
  - "What are you talking about?"
  - "你在说什么？"

  ---
  - "We've been invaded. From some other universe, some other dimension. They're insects. Mimicry. And more. Power to control minds. Your mind."
  - "我们被入侵了。来自另一个宇宙，另一个维度。它们是昆虫。模仿。还有更多。控制心灵的力量。你的心灵。"

  ---
  - "My mind?"
  - "我的心灵？"

  ---
  - "Their entrance is here, in Pikeville. They've taken over all of you. The whole town—except me. We're up against an incredibly powerful enemy, but they have their limitations. That's our hope. They're limited! They can make mistakes!" Janet shook her head. "I don't understand, Ed. You must be insane."
  - "他们的入口就在这里，派克维尔。他们已经控制了你们所有人。整个镇子——除了我。我们面对的是一个极其强大的敌人，但他们也有局限。这是我们的希望。它们数量有限！他们会犯错！"珍妮特摇了摇头。"我不明白，埃德。你一定疯了。"

  ---
  - "Insane? No. Just lucky. If I hadn't been down in the basement I'd be like all the rest of you." Loyce peered out the window. "But I can't stand here talking. Get your coat."
  - "疯了？不。只是运气好。如果我没在地下室，我早就和你们其他人一样了。"洛伊斯望向窗外。"但我不能站在这里说话。拿上你的外套。"

  ---
  - "My coat?"
  - "我的外套？"

  ---
  - "We're getting out of here. Out of Pikeville. We've got to get help. Fight this thing. They can be beaten. They're not infallible. It's going to be close—but we may make it if we hurry. Come on!" He grabbed her arm roughly. "Get your coat and call the twins. We're all leaving. Don't stop to pack. There's no time for that."
  - "我们得离开这里。从派克维尔出来。我们得去寻求帮助。抗争这东西。他们是可以被打败的。他们并非万无一失。比赛会很紧张——但如果我们快点，或许能赶上。快点！"他粗暴地抓住她的手臂。"穿上外套，叫双胞胎。我们都要走了。别停下来收拾东西。没时间了。"

  ---
  - White-faced, his wife moved toward the closet and got down her coat. "Where are we going?"
  - 脸色发白，妻子走向衣橱，脱下外套。"我们要去哪儿？"

  ---
  - Ed pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out onto the floor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. "They'll have the highway covered, of course. But there's a back road. To Oak Grove. I got onto it once. It's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about it."
  - 埃德拉开书桌抽屉，把东西洒在地上。他拿起一张路线图，摊开。"他们当然会把高速公路都覆盖好。但有条小路。去橡树林。我曾经接触过一次。几乎是废弃的。也许他们会忘了这事。"

  ---
  - "The old Ranch Road? Good Lord—it's completely closed. Nobody's supposed to drive over it."
  - "老牧场路？天哪——完全关门了。没人应该开车越过它。"

  ---
  - "I know." Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. "That's our best chance. Now call down the twins and let's get going. Your car is full of gas, isn't it?"
  - "我知道。"埃德阴沉地把地图塞进外套里。"那是我们最好的机会。现在叫双胞胎下来，我们出发。你的车里油是不是满的？"

  ---
  - Janet was dazed.珍妮特有些恍惚。

  ---
  - "The Chevy? I had it filled up yesterday afternoon." Janet moved toward the stairs. "Ed, I—"
  - "雪佛兰？我昨天下午已经加满了。"珍妮特朝楼梯走去。"艾德，我——"

  ---
  - "Call the twins!" Ed unlocked the front door and peered out. Nothing stirred. No sign of life. All right so far.
  - "叫双胞胎！"埃德打开前门，往外看。什么都没动。没有生命迹象。到目前为止还行。

  ---
  - "Come on downstairs," Janet called in a wavering voice. "We're—going out for a while."
  - "快下来，"珍妮特声音颤抖地喊道。"我们——出去一会儿。"

  ---
  - "Now?" Tommy's voice came.
  - "现在？"汤米的声音响起。

  ---
  - "Hurry up," Ed barked. "Get down here, both of you."
  - "快点，"埃德厉声说道。"你们俩都下来。"

  ---
  - Tommy appeared at the top of the stairs. "I was doing my homework. We're starting fractions. Miss Parker says if we don't get this done—"
  - 汤米出现在楼梯顶端。"我在做作业。我们开始分段。帕克小姐说如果我们不完成这件事——"

  ---
  - "You can forget about fractions." Ed grabbed his son as he came down the stairs and propelled him toward the door. "Where's Jim?"
  - "分数你可以忘了。"埃德在儿子下楼时抓住他，推他朝门口走去。"吉姆在哪儿？"

  ---
  - "He's coming."
  - "他来了。"

  ---
  - Jim started slowly down the stairs. "What's up, Dad?"
  - 吉姆慢慢下楼。"怎么了，爸爸？"

  ---
  - "We're going for a ride."
  - "我们要去兜风。"

  ---
  - "A ride? Where?"
  - "搭便车？在哪里？"

  ---
  - Ed turned to Janet. "We'll leave the lights on. And the TV set. Go turn it on." He pushed her toward the set. "So they'll think we're still—"
  - 埃德转向珍妮特。"我们会开灯。还有电视机。去打开它。"他推着她走向片场。"所以他们会以为我们还是——"

  ---
  - He heard the buzz. And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out. Sickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of motion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy. It was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse—the thing hurtling at him, cold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow T-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange half-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing?
  - 他听到了嗡嗡声。然后立刻掉落，长刀拔出。他感到恶心，看到它从楼梯上冲过来，翅膀一阵模糊地朝他瞄准。它依然和吉米有些模糊的相似。它很小，是个婴儿。一瞥——那个朝他飞来的东西，冰冷、多重镜片的非人类眼睛。翅膀，身体还穿着黄色T恤和牛仔裤，模仿者的轮廓还印在上面。它身体奇怪地转了半圈，走近他。它在做什么？

  ---
  - A stinger.
  - 一根刺。

  ---
  - Loyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce rolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as statues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again. This time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It bounced against the wall and fluttered down.
  - 洛伊斯疯狂地刺向它。它疯狂地嗡嗡作响地退了回去。洛伊斯翻滚着，爬向门口。汤米和珍妮特像雕像一样一动不动，脸上没有表情。无表情地注视着。洛伊斯又刺了一刀。这次刀子击中了。那东西尖叫着，踉跄了一下。它撞击墙壁，然后扑腾着落下。

  ---

  ---
  - Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien mind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his own, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utter alien presence, settling over him—and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a broken heap on the rug.
  - 有什么东西在他脑海中掠过。一堵力量之墙，能量，一个外星意识在探查他。他突然瘫痪了。意识进入了他的心灵，短暂地触碰了他，令人震惊。一种完全陌生的存在笼罩着他——然后它在地毯上崩塌成一团破碎的存在，闪烁着消灭。

  ---
  - It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of some kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy... He closed his mind tight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his knife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still, neither of them moving.
  - 它死了。他用脚把它翻了个身。那是一只昆虫，某种苍蝇。黄色T恤，牛仔裤。他的儿子吉米......他紧闭心扉。现在想这些已经太晚了。他愤怒地抓起刀，朝门口走去。珍妮特和汤米一动不动，谁也没有动。

  ---
  - The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It was ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and open fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone.
  - 车坏了。他永远也打不过去。他们会等着他。步行要十英里。十英里漫长的路程，穿越崎岖的地形、峡谷、开阔的田野和未被砍伐的森林丘陵。他得一个人去。

  ---
  - Loyce opened the door. For a brief second he looked back at his wife and son. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps.
  - 洛伊斯打开了门。他短暂地回头看了看妻子和儿子。然后他砰地关上门，飞快地跑下门廊的台阶。

  ---
  - A moment later he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness toward the edge of town.
  - 片刻后，他便匆匆穿过黑暗，朝镇边走去。

  ---
  - The early morning sunlight was blinding. Loyce halted, gasping for breath, swaying back and forth. Sweat ran down in his eyes. His clothing was torn, shredded by the brush and thorns through which he had crawled. Ten miles—on his hands and knees. Crawling, creeping through the night. His shoes were mud-caked. He was scratched and limping, utterly exhausted. But ahead of him lay Oak Grove.
  - 清晨的阳光刺眼。洛伊斯停下脚步，喘着气，身体前后摇晃。汗水顺着他的眼睛滑落。他的衣服被灌木和荆棘撕裂，被他爬过的荆棘撕裂。十英里——用手和膝盖爬行。爬行，在夜色中悄悄爬行。他的鞋子沾满了泥。他满身抓痕，跛行，彻底疲惫不堪。但眼前是橡树林。

  ---
  - He took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice he stumbled and fell, picking himself up and trudging on. His ears rang. Everything receded and wavered. But he was there. He had got out, away from Pikeville.
  - 他深吸一口气，开始下山。他两次跌倒，挣扎着继续前行。他的耳朵嗡嗡作响。一切都退去，摇摆不定。但他确实在那里。他已经逃出去，远离了派克维尔。

  ---
  - A farmer in a field gaped at him. From a house a young woman watched in wonder. Loyce reached the road and turned onto it. Ahead of him was a gasoline station and a drive-in. A couple of trucks, some chickens pecking in the dirt, a dog tied with a string.
  - 田里的农夫目瞪口呆地看着他。一位年轻女子在一所房子里惊奇地注视着。洛伊斯走到马路边，转上了路。他面前是一个加油站和一家汽车影院。几辆卡车，几只鸡在泥土里啄食，一只用绳子绑着的狗。

  ---
  - The white-clad attendant watched suspiciously as he dragged himself up to the station. "Thank God." He caught hold of the wall. "I didn't think I was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear them buzzing. Buzzing and flitting around behind me."
  - 身穿白衣的工作人员怀疑地看着他拖着自己走向车站。"谢天谢地。"他抓住了墙壁。"我没想到我能挺过去。他们大部分路程都跟着我。我能听到它们嗡嗡作响。在我身后嗡嗡飞舞。"

  ---
  - "What happened?" the attendant demanded. "You in a wreck? A holdup?"
  - "发生了什么？"侍者质问。"你出事了吗？抢劫？"

  ---
  - Loyce shook his head wearily. "They have the whole town. The City Hall and the police station. They hung a man from the lamppost. That was the first thing I saw. They've got all the roads blocked. I saw them hovering over the cars coming in. About four this morning I got beyond them. I knew it right away. I could feel them leave. And then the sun came up."
  - 洛伊斯疲惫地摇了摇头。"他们掌控了整个镇子。市政厅和警察局。他们把一个人吊在路灯柱上。那是我看到的第一件事。他们把所有路都封锁了。我看到他们在驶入的车辆上方盘旋。今天凌晨四点左右，我越过了它们。我立刻就知道了。我能感觉到他们离开了。然后太阳升起了。"

  ---
  - The attendant licked his lip nervously. "You're out of your head. I better get a doctor."
  - 服务员紧张地舔了舔嘴唇。"你疯了。我最好去找医生。"

  ---
  - "Get me into Oak Grove," Loyce gasped. He sank down on the gravel. "We've got to get started—cleaning them out. Got to get started right away."
  - "带我进橡树林，"洛伊斯喘息着说。他坐在碎石上。"我们得开始了——清理它们。得马上开始。"

  ---
  - They kept a tape recorder going all the time he talked. When he had finished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet. He stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his cigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.
  - 他说话的时候，他们一直开着录音机。说完后，专员啪地关掉录音机，站了起来。他站了一会儿，陷入沉思。终于他掏出香烟，慢慢点燃，厚实的脸上带着皱眉。

  ---
  - "You don't believe me," Loyce said.
  - "你不相信我，"洛伊斯说。

  ---
  - The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently away. "Suit yourself." The Commissioner moved over to the window and stood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. "I believe you," he said abruptly.
  - 专员递给他一根烟。洛伊斯不耐烦地把它推开。"随你便。"专员走到窗边，站了一会儿，望着橡树林镇。"我相信你，"他突然说。

  ---
  - Loyce sagged. "Thank God."
  - 洛伊斯垂下了肩膀。"谢天谢地。"

  ---
  - "So you got away." The Commissioner shook his head. "You were down in your cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million."
  - "所以你逃掉了。"专员摇了摇头。"你当时在地窖里，而不是在工作。一个罕见的机会。百万分之一。"

  ---
  - Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. "I have a theory," he murmured.
  - 洛伊斯啜饮着他们带来的黑咖啡。"我有个理论，"他低声说。

  ---
  - "What is it?"
  - "怎么了？"

  ---
  - "About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting at the top—the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a widening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next town. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on for a long time."
  - "关于他们。他们是谁。他们一次接管一个区域。从最高层开始——最高权威层级。从那里开始，沿着一个逐渐扩大的圆环推进。当他们牢牢掌控局面时，他们会前往下一个城镇。它们慢慢地、非常缓慢地扩散开来。我觉得这已经持续很久了。"

  ---
  - "A long time?"
  - "很久了？"

  ---
  - "Thousands of years. I don't think it's new."
  - "几千年了。我觉得这并不新鲜。"

  ---
  - "Why do you say that?"
  - "你为什么这么说？"

  ---
  - "When I was a kid... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A religious picture—an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah. Moloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth—"
  - "我小时候......这是他们在圣经联盟里给我们看的照片。一幅宗教画——一幅老版画。敌对的神明，被耶和华击败。摩洛克、别西卜、摩押、巴林、亚斯他罗——"

  ---
  - "So?"
  - "那又怎样？"

  ---
  - "They were all represented by figures." Loyce looked up at the Commissioner. "Beelzebub was represented as—a giant fly."
  - "他们都被人形代表。"洛伊斯抬头看着局长。"别西卜被描绘成——一只巨大的苍蝇。"

  ---
  - The Commissioner grunted. "An old struggle."
  - 专员咕哝了一声。"一场旧争斗。"

  ---
  - "They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They make gains—but finally they're defeated."
  - "他们被击败了。圣经是他们失败的记载。他们取得了进展——但最终还是被击败了。"

  ---
  - "Why defeated?"
  - "为什么会被击败？"

  ---
  - "They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the Hebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The realization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they understood. Had escaped, like I did." He clenched his fists. "I killed one of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance."
  - "他们不可能抓到所有人。他们没抓到我。他们从未得到希伯来人。希伯来人将这个信息传给了全世界。意识到危险。公交车上的两个男人。我觉得他们理解了。逃脱了，就像我一样。"他握紧拳头。"我杀了其中一个。我犯了个错误。我害怕冒险。"

  ---
  - The Commissioner nodded. "Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did. Freak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control." He turned from the window, "Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured everything out."
  - 专员点了点头。"是的，他们无疑逃脱了，就像你一样。意外。但镇上其他人牢牢掌控着局面。"他从窗边转过身，"好吧，洛伊斯先生。你似乎已经把一切都弄明白了。"

  ---
  - "Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the lamppost. I don't understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there?"
  - "不是全部。绞刑犯。吊在路灯杆上的死者。我不明白。为什么？他们为什么故意把他吊在那里？"

  ---
  - "That would seem simple." The Commissioner smiled faintly. "Bait."
  - "这看起来很简单。"专员微微一笑。"诱饵。"

  ---
  - Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. "Bait? What do you mean?"
  - 洛伊斯僵住了。他的心停止跳动。"诱饵？你什么意思？"

  ---
  - "To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was under control—and who had escaped."
  - "引你出来。让你表明身份。这样他们才能知道谁被控制住了——谁逃脱了。"

  ---
  - Loyce recoiled with horror. "Then they expected failures! They anticipated—" He broke off. "They were ready with a trap." "And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known." The Commissioner abruptly moved toward the door. "Come along, Loyce. There's a lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste."
  - 洛伊斯惊恐地后退。"那他们就预料失败了！他们预料到了——"他话锋一转，"他们已经准备好了陷阱。""你现身了。你做出了反应。你已经让自己被注意到了。"专员突然朝门口走去。"走吧，洛伊斯。有很多事情要做。我们得赶紧行动。没时间浪费了。"

  ---
  - Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. "And the man. Who was the man? I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger. All muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed—"
  - 洛伊斯慢慢站起身，麻木着。"还有那个人。那个人是谁？我以前从没见过他。他不是本地人。他是个陌生人。满身泥泞肮脏，脸被划破——"

  ---
  - There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered, "Maybe," he said softly, "you'll understand that, too. Come along with me, Mr. Loyce." He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a glimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a platform of some sort. A telephone pole—and a rope! "Right this way," the Commissioner said, smiling coldly.
  - 局长脸上露出奇怪的表情回答："也许吧，"他轻声说，"你也会明白的。跟我来，洛伊斯先生。"他扶着门，眼睛闪闪发光。洛伊斯瞥见警察局前的街道。警察，某种平台。一根电线杆——还有一根绳子！"这边请，"专员冷冷地笑着说。

  ---
