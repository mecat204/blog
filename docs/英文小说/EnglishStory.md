### 0001. The Hanging Stranger | 绞刑陌生人
  - The Hanging Stranger
  - 绞刑陌生人

  - by Philip K. Dick
  - 作者：菲利普·K·迪克

  - At five o'clock Ed Loyce washed up, tossed on his hat and coat, got his car out and headed across town toward his TV sales store. He was tired. His back and shoulders ached from digging dirt out of the basement and wheeling it into the back yard. But for a forty-year-old man he had done okay. Janet could get a new vase with the money he had saved; and he liked the idea of repairing the foundations himself.
  - 五点钟，埃德·洛伊斯洗漱完毕，戴上帽子和外套，开车穿过城镇，前往他的电视销售店。他累了。他的背和肩膀因为从地下室挖土推到后院而酸痛。但对于一个四十岁的男人来说，他表现还算不错。珍妮特可以用他攒下的钱买一个新花瓶;而且他喜欢自己修复地基的想法。

  ---
  - It was getting dark. The setting sun cast long rays over the scurrying commuters, tired and grim-faced, women loaded down with bundles and packages, students, swarming home from the university, mixing with clerks and businessmen and drab secretaries. He stopped his Packard for a red light and then started it up again. The store had been open without him; he'd arrive just in time to spell the help for dinner, go over the records of the day, maybe even close a couple of sales himself. He drove slowly past the small square of green in the center of the street, the town park. There were no parking places in front of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. He cursed under his breath and swung the car in a U-turn. Again he passed the little square of green with its lonely drinking fountain and bench and single lamppost.
  - 天色渐暗。落日洒下长长的阳光，洒在匆忙的通勤者身上，疲惫而面色凝重，背负着包裹和包裹的妇女们，学生们从大学蜂拥而至，与职员、商人和沉闷的秘书混在一起。他停下帕卡德等红灯，然后又发动了。店铺在没有他的情况下还开着;他会及时赶到，给帮手咒语叫晚餐，查看当天的记录，甚至可能亲自完成几笔交易。他慢慢开车经过街道中央那片小小的绿地——镇上的公园。LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE 门口没有停车位。他低声咒骂，转身掉头。他再次经过那片绿地，那里有孤零零的饮水喷泉、长椅和一根路灯。

  ---
  - From the lamppost something was hanging. A shapeless dark bundle, swinging a little with the wind. Like a dummy of some sort. Loyce rolled down his window and peered out. What the hell was it? A display of some kind? Sometimes the Chamber of Commerce put up displays in the square.
  - 路灯杆上挂着什么东西。一个无形的黑暗包裹，随风轻轻摆动。就像个假人。洛伊斯摇下车窗，往外看。到底是什么？某种展示？有时商会会在广场上布置展览。

  ---
  - Again he made a U-turn and brought his car around. He passed the park and concentrated on the dark bundle. It wasn't a dummy. And if it was a display it was a strange kind. The hackles on his neck rose and he swallowed uneasily. Sweat slid out on his face and hands.
  - 他又掉头，把车开了过来。他经过公园，专注于那个黑暗的包裹。那不是假人。如果说是展示，那也是一种奇怪的展示。脖子上的毛竖起，他不安地咽了口口水。汗水滑落在他的脸和手上。

  ---
  - It was a body. A human body.
  - 那是一具尸体。一具人体。

  ---
  - "Look at it!" Loyce snapped. "Come on out here!"
  - "看看它！"洛伊斯厉声说道。"出来吧！"

  ---
  - Don Fergusson came slowly out of the store, buttoning his pin-stripe coat with dignity. "This is a big deal, Ed. I can't just leave the guy standing there."
  - 唐·弗格森慢慢地走出店里，端庄地扣上条纹外套的扣子。"这很重要，埃德。我不能就这么让那家伙站在那里。"

  ---
  - "See it?" Ed pointed into the gathering gloom. The lamppost jutted up against the sky—the post and the bundle swinging from it. "There it is. How the hell long has it been there?" His voice rose excitedly. "What's wrong with everybody? They just walk on past!"
  - "看到了吗？"埃德指向渐渐聚集的昏暗。路灯柱顶向天空——灯柱和那个包裹从上面荡来荡去。"就是那里。它到底放了多久？"他的声音兴奋地提高了。"大家怎么了？他们就这样走过去！"

  ---
  - Don Fergusson lit a cigarette slowly. "Take it easy, old man. There must be a good reason, or it wouldn't be there."
  - 唐·弗格森慢慢点燃了一支烟。"别激动，老头。一定有充分的理由，否则就不会有。"

  ---
  - "A reason! What kind of a reason?"
  - "理由！什么理由？"

  ---
  - Fergusson shrugged. "Like the time the Traffic Safety Council put that wrecked Buick there. Some sort of civic thing. How would I know?"
  - 弗格森耸耸肩。"就像交通安全委员会把那辆报废的别克放在那里一样。某种市政活动。我怎么会知道？"

  ---
  - Jack Potter from the shoe shop joined them. "What's up, boys?"
  - 鞋店的杰克·波特加入了他们。"怎么了，伙计们？"

  ---
  - "There's a body hanging from the lamppost," Loyce said. "I'm going to call the cops."
  - "路灯杆上挂着一具尸体，"洛伊斯说。"我要报警了。"

  ---
  - "They must know about it," Potter said. "Or otherwise it wouldn't be there."
  - "他们一定知道这件事，"波特说。"否则它就不会存在。"

  ---
  - "I got to get back in." Fergusson headed back into the store. "Business before pleasure."
  - "我得回去了。"弗格森回到了店里。"公事重于享乐。"

  ---
  - Loyce began to get hysterical. "You see it? You see it hanging there? A man's body! A dead man!" "Sure, Ed. I saw it this afternoon when I went out for coffee."
  - 洛伊斯开始歇斯底里。"你看见了吗？你看到它挂在那里了吗？一具男人的身体！一个死人！""当然，埃德。我今天下午出去喝咖啡时看到的。"

  ---
  - "You mean it's been there all afternoon?"
  - "你是说它整个下午都在那里？"

  ---
  - "Sure. What's the matter?" Potter glanced at his watch. "Have to run. See you later, Ed."
  - "当然。怎么了？"波特看了看手表。"得走了。回头见，埃德。"

  ---
  - Potter hurried off, joining the flow of people moving along the sidewalk. Men and women, passing by the park. A few glanced up curiously at the dark bundle—and then went on. Nobody stopped. Nobody paid any attention.
  - 波特匆匆离开，加入了人行道上人流。男女经过公园。有几个人好奇地抬头看了看那个黑色包裹——然后继续说。没人停下来。没人注意。

  ---
  - "I'm going nuts," Loyce whispered. He made his way to the curb and crossed out into traffic, among the cars. Horns honked angrily at him. He gained the curb and stepped up onto the little square of green.
  - "我快疯了，"洛伊斯低声说。他走到路边，穿过车流，穿过车流，穿梭在车流中。喇叭愤怒地对他鸣响。他走上路缘，踏上那片绿色的小方块。

  ---
  - The man had been middle-aged. His clothing was ripped and torn, a gray suit, splashed and caked with dried mud. A stranger. Loyce had never seen him before. Not a local man. His face was partly turned away, and in the evening wind he spun a little, turning gently, silently. His skin was gouged and cut. Red gashes, deep scratches of congealed blood. A pair of steel-rimmed glasses hung from one ear, dangling foolishly. His eyes bulged. His mouth was open, tongue thick and ugly blue.
  - 那人已经中年了。他的衣服破烂不堪，是一套灰色西装，满是干涸的泥巴和泥巴。一个陌生人。洛伊斯以前从未见过他。不是本地人。他的脸半转过身，晚风中他轻轻转身，默默无声地转了个身。他的皮肤被挖伤和割伤。红色的伤口，凝结的血迹深深划痕。一副钢框眼镜从一只耳朵上挂着，笨拙地垂着。他的眼睛瞪得大大的。他的嘴张开，舌头粗糙且丑陋的蓝色。

  ---
  - "For Heaven's sake," Loyce muttered, sickened. He pushed down his nausea and made his way back to the sidewalk. He was shaking all over, with revulsion—and fear.
  - "看在上帝的份上，"洛伊斯低声嘟囔，感到恶心。他压下恶心，走回人行道。他浑身颤抖，充满厌恶和恐惧。

  ---
  - Why? Who was the man? Why was he hanging there? What did it mean?
  - 为什么？那个人是谁？他为什么挂在那里？这意味着什么？

  ---
  - And—why didn't anybody notice?
  - 而且——为什么没人注意到？

  ---
  - He bumped into a small man hurrying along the sidewalk. "Watch it!" the man grated. "Oh, it's you, Ed."
  - 他撞上了一个匆匆走在人行道上的小个子男人。"小心点！"那人咬牙切齿地说。"哦，是你啊，艾德。"

  ---
  - Ed nodded dazedly. "Hello, Jenkins."
  - 埃德迷迷糊糊地点了点头。"你好，詹金斯。"

  ---
  - "What's the matter?" The stationery clerk caught Ed's aim "You look sick."
  - "怎么了？"文具店员抓住了埃德的目光，"你看起来病了。"

  ---
  - "The body. There in the park."
  - "尸体。就在公园里。"

  ---
  - "Sure, Ed." Jenkins led him into the alcove of LOYCE TV SALES AND SERVICE. "Take it easy."
  - "当然，埃德。"詹金斯带他进入了洛伊斯电视销售与服务部的角落。"别激动。"

  ---
  - Margaret Henderson from the jewelry store joined them. "Something wrong?"
  - 珠宝店的玛格丽特·亨德森加入了他们。"有什么不对劲吗？"

  ---
  - "Ed's not feeling well."
  - "埃德身体不舒服。"

  ---
  - Loyce yanked himself free. "How can you stand here? Don't you see it? For God's sake—" "What's he talking about?" Margaret asked nervously.
  - 洛伊斯挣脱了出来。"你怎么能站在这里？你没看出来吗？看在上帝的份上——" "他在说什么？"玛格丽特紧张地问。

  ---
  - "The body!" Ed shouted. "The body hanging there!"
  - "尸体！"埃德喊道。"那具尸体挂在那里！"

  ---
  - More people collected. "Is he sick? It's Ed Loyce. You okay, Ed?"
  - 更多人聚集。"他生病了吗？是埃德·洛伊斯。你还好吗，埃德？"

  ---
  - "The body!" Loyce screamed, struggling to get past them. Hands caught at him. He tore loose. "Let me go! The police! Get the police!"
  - "尸体！"洛伊斯尖叫着，挣扎着想从他们身边突破。手抓住了他。他挣脱了。"放开我！警察！快叫警察！"

  ---
  - "Ed—"
  - "艾德——"

  ---
  - "Better get a doctor!"
  - "最好去找医生！"

  ---
  - "He must be sick."
  - "他一定是生病了。"

  ---
  - "Or drunk."
  - "或者喝醉了。"

  ---
  - Loyce fought his way through the people. He stumbled and half fell. Through a blur he saw rows of faces, curious, concerned, anxious. Men and women halting to see what the disturbance was. He fought past them toward his store. He could see Fergusson inside talking to a man, showing him an Emerson TV set. Pete Foley in the back at the service counter, setting up a new Philco. Loyce shouted at them frantically. His voice was lost in the roar of traffic and the murmuring around him.
  - 洛伊斯在人群中奋力杀出重围。他踉跄了一下，半摔了一跤。透过一团模糊，他看到一排排面孔，好奇、担忧、焦虑。男女停下脚步，想看看发生了什么骚动。他冲过他们，朝自己的店铺走去。他看到弗格森在屋里和一个人说话，给他看一台埃默森电视。皮特·福利在后排服务柜台，准备新的菲尔科。洛伊斯慌乱地喊着。他的声音被车流的轰鸣和周围的低语淹没。

  ---
  - "Do something!" he screamed. "Don't stand there! Do something! Something's wrong! Something's happened! Things are going on!" The crowd melted respectfully for the two heavy-set cops moving efficiently toward Loyce.
  - "做点什么！"他大喊。"别站在那里！做点什么！有问题！出事了！事情正在发生！"人群为这两名身材魁梧的警察高效地朝洛伊斯走来感到敬意。

  ---
  - "Name?" the cop with the notebook murmured.
  - "名字？"拿着笔记本的警察低声问。

  ---
  - "Loyce." He mopped his forehead wearily. "Edward C. Loyce. Listen to me. Back there—"
  - "洛伊斯。"他疲惫地擦了擦额头。"爱德华·C·洛伊斯。听我说。刚才——"

  ---
  - "Address?" the cop demanded. The police car moved swiftly through traffic, shooting among the cars and buses. Loyce sagged against the seat, exhausted and confused. He took a deep shuddering breath.
  - "地址？"警察质问。警车迅速穿过车流，在车辆和公交车间开枪。洛伊斯瘫坐在座位上，疲惫又困惑。他深深吸了一口气，颤抖着。

  ---
  - "1368 Hurst Road."
  - "赫斯特路1368号。"

  ---
  - "That's here in Pikeville?"
  - "那是在派克维尔？"

  ---
  - "That's right." Loyce pulled himself up with a violent effort. "Listen to me. Back there. In the square. Hanging from the lamppost—"
  - "没错。"洛伊斯用力拉起自己。"听我说。就在那儿。在广场上。挂在路灯杆上——"

  ---
  - "Where were you today?" the cop behind the wheel demanded.
  - "你今天去哪儿了？"驾驶员质问。

  ---
  - "Where?" Loyce echoed.
  - "去哪儿？"洛伊斯重复道。

  ---
  - "You weren't in your shop, were you?"
  - "你不在店里吧？"

  ---
  - "No." He shook his head. "No, I was home. Down in the basement."
  - "不。"他摇了摇头。"不，我当时在家。在地下室。"

  ---
  - "In the basement?"
  - "在地下室？"

  ---
  - "Digging. A new foundation. Getting out the dirt to pour a cement frame. Why? What has that to do with—"
  - "挖。一个新的基础。把泥土挖出来浇筑水泥框架。为什么？这和——有什么关系？"

  ---
  - "Was anybody else down there with you?"
  - "还有别人和你一起在下面吗？"

  ---
  - "No. My wife was downtown. My kids were at school." Loyce looked from one heavy-set cop to the other. Hope flickered across his face, wild hope. "You mean because I was down there I missed—the explanation? I didn't get in on it? Like everybody else?" After a pause the cop with the notebook said: "That's right. You missed the explanation."
  - "不。我妻子当时在市中心。我孩子们都在学校。"洛伊斯从一个身材魁梧的警察看向另一个。希望在他脸上闪过，狂野的希望。"你的意思是因为我在那里，我错过了——解释？我没参与？像其他人一样？"停顿后，拿着笔记本的警察说："没错。你错过了解释。"

  ---
  - "Then it's official? The body—it's supposed to be hanging there?"
  - "那就正式了？尸体——应该挂在那里？"

  ---
  - "It's supposed to be hanging there. For everybody to see."
  - "它本该挂在那里。让所有人都看见。"

  ---
  - Ed Loyce grinned weakly. "Good Lord. I guess I sort of went off the deep end. I thought maybe something had happened. You know, something like the Ku Klux Klan. Some kind of violence. Communists or Fascists taking over." He wiped his face with his breast-pocket handkerchief, his hands shaking. "I'm glad to know it's on the level."
  - 埃德·洛伊斯虚弱地笑了笑。"天哪。我想我有点失控了。我以为可能发生了什么事。你知道的，类似三K党那样的组织。某种暴力。共产主义者或法西斯接管。"他用胸前口袋的手帕擦了擦脸，手在颤抖。"很高兴知道你说的是真的。"

  ---
  - "It's on the level." The police car was getting near the Hall of Justice. The sun had set. The streets were gloomy and dark. The lights had not yet come on.
  - "这是真的。"警车快到司法大厅了。太阳已经落山。街道阴沉黑暗。灯还没亮。

  ---
  - "I feel better," Loyce said. "I was pretty excited there, for a minute. I guess I got all stirred up. Now that I understand, there's no need to take me in, is there?"
  - "我感觉好多了，"洛伊斯说。"我刚才还挺兴奋的，刚才有那么一会儿。我想我被激动了。既然我明白了，没必要收留我，对吧？"

  ---
  - The two cops said nothing.
  - 两名警察一言不发。

  ---
  - "I should be back at my store. The boys haven't had dinner. I'm all right, now. No more trouble. Is there any need of—" "This won't take long," the cop behind the wheel interrupted. "A short process. Only a few minutes."
  - "我应该回我的店了。男孩们还没吃晚饭呢。我现在没事了。不再麻烦了。需要——""这不会花太久时间，"驾驶员打断了他。"过程很短。只有几分钟。"

  ---
  - "I hope it's short," Loyce muttered. The car slowed down for a stoplight. "I guess I sort of disturbed the peace. Funny, getting excited like that and—"
  - "希望它能短一点，"洛伊斯嘟囔道。车子减速等红绿灯。"我想我有点打扰了安宁。真有趣，居然这么激动——"

  ---
  - Loyce yanked the door open. He sprawled out into the street and rolled to his feet. Cars were moving all around him, gaining speed as the light changed. Loyce leaped onto the curb and raced among the people, burrowing into the swarming crowds. Behind him he heard sounds, snouts, people running.
  - 洛伊斯猛地拉开门。他摊开在街上，滚了起来。周围的汽车不断移动，随着红灯变换加速。洛伊斯跳上人行道，在人群中奔跑，钻进人群中。身后传来声音，鼻子声，有人奔跑。

  ---
  - They weren't cops. He had realized that right away. He knew every cop in Pikeville. A man couldn't own a store, operate a business in a small town for twenty-five years without getting to know all the cops.
  - 他们不是警察。他立刻意识到了这一点。他认识派克维尔的每一个警察。一个男人不可能在一个小镇上开店、经营生意二十五年而不认识所有警察。

  ---
  - They weren't cops—and there hadn't been any explanation. Potter, Fergusson, Jenkins, none of them knew why it was there. They didn't know—and they didn't care. That was the strange part.
  - 他们不是警察——也没有任何解释。波特、弗格森、詹金斯，他们都不知道为什么会在那里。他们不知道——也不在乎。这就是奇怪的地方。

  ---
  - Loyce ducked into a hardware store. He raced toward the back, past the startled clerks and customers, into the shipping room and through the back door. He tripped over a garbage can and ran up a flight of concrete steps. He climbed over a fence and jumped down on the other side, gasping and panting.
  - 洛伊斯躲进了一家五金店。他冲向后面，越过惊讶的店员和顾客，进入发货室，穿过后门。他绊倒在一个垃圾桶上，跑上了一段混凝土台阶。他翻过篱笆，跳到另一边，喘着气。

  ---
  - There was no sound behind him. He had got away.
  - 身后没有任何声音。他逃脱了。

  ---
  - He was at the entrance of an alley, dark and strewn with boards and ruined boxes and tires. He could see the street at the far end. A street light wavered and came on. Men and women. Stores. Neon signs. Cars.
  - 他站在一条小巷的入口，黑暗中散落着木板、破损的箱子和轮胎。他能看到远处的街道。一盏路灯摇晃着亮了起来。男人和女人。商店。霓虹灯。汽车。

  ---
  - And to his right—the police station.
  - 右边是警察局。

  ---
  - He was close, terribly close. Past the loading platform of a grocery store rose the white concrete side of the Hall of Justice. Barred windows. The police antenna. A great concrete wall rising up in the darkness. A bad place for him to be near. He was too close. He had to keep moving, get farther away from them.
  - 他很接近，非常接近。穿过一家杂货店的装卸平台，是司法大厅白色混凝土的一侧。有铁栏窗。警察天线。一堵巨大的混凝土墙在黑暗中升起。对他来说是个糟糕的地方。他离得太近了。他必须继续前进，离他们更远。

  ---
  - Them?
  - 他们？

  ---
  - Loyce moved cautiously down the alley. Beyond the police station was the City Hall, the old-fashioned yellow structure of wood and gilded brass and broad cement steps. He could see the endless rows of offices, dark windows, the cedars and beds of flowers on each side of the entrance.
  - 洛伊斯小心翼翼地沿着小巷走去。警察局外是市政厅，那是一座老式的黄色建筑，由木质、镀金黄铜和宽阔的水泥台阶组成。他能看到无尽的办公室排队、黑色的窗户、入口两侧的雪松和花坛。

  ---
  - And—something else.
  - 还有——还有别的东西。

  ---
  - Above the City Hall was a patch of darkness, a cone of gloom denser than the surrounding night. A prism of black that spread out and was lost into the sky.
  - 市政厅上方是一片黑暗，阴郁的锥形比周围的夜晚还要浓密。一道黑色棱镜扩散开来，消失在天空中。

  ---
  - He listened. Good God, he could hear something. Something that made him struggle frantically to close his ears, his mind, to shut out the sound. A buzzing. A distant, muted hum like a great swarm of bees.
  - 他倾听着。天哪，他能听到什么声音。让他拼命想闭上耳朵、闭上心灵，把声音隔绝。嗡嗡声。远处传来一阵低沉的嗡鸣，像一大群蜜蜂。

  ---
  - Loyce gazed up, rigid with horror. The splotch of darkness, hanging over the City Hall. Darkness so thick it seemed almost solid. In the vortex something moved. Flickering shapes. Things, descending from the sky, pausing momentarily above the City Hall, fluttering over it in a dense swarm and then dropping silently onto the roof.
  - 洛伊斯惊恐地抬头，僵硬地盯着。那片黑暗的斑点，悬挂在市政厅上空。黑暗厚重得几乎像实体一样。在漩涡中，有什么东西动了。闪烁的形状。物体从天而降，在市政厅上空短暂停留，密集地飞过，然后无声地落在屋顶上。

  ---
  - Shapes. Fluttering shapes from the sky. From the crack of darkness that hung above him. He was seeing—them.
  - 形状。天空中飘落的身影。从头顶那道黑暗的裂缝中。他看见了——他们。

  ---
  - For a long time Loyce watched, crouched behind a sagging fence in a pool of scummy water.
  - 洛伊斯蹲在一堵下陷的围栏后，浸泡在污浊的水池中，观察了很久。

  ---
  - They were landing. Coming down in groups, landing on the roof of the City Hall and disappearing inside. They had wings. Like giant insects of some kind. They flew and fluttered and came to rest—and then crawled crab-fashion, sideways, across the roof and into the building.
  - 他们正在降落。他们成群结队地降落，落在市政厅屋顶，然后消失在里面。他们有翅膀。像某种巨型昆虫。它们飞翔、扑腾，停下——然后像螃蟹一样侧身爬过屋顶，进入建筑物。

  ---
  - He was sickened. And fascinated. Cold night wind blew around him and he shuddered. He was tired, dazed with shock. On the front steps of the City Hall were men, standing here and there. Groups of men coming out of the building and halting for a moment before going on.
  - 他感到恶心。而且很着迷。冷冽的夜风在他周围吹来，他不禁打了个寒颤。他疲惫不堪，震惊得头晕目眩。市政厅前台阶上，站着一些男人。一群群男人从建筑里走出来，停顿片刻后继续前行。

  ---
  - Were there more of them?
  - 他们还有更多吗？

  ---
  - It didn't seem possible. What he saw descending from the black chasm weren't men. They were alien—from some other world, some other dimension. Sliding through this slit, this break in the shell of the universe. Entering through this gap, winged insects from another realm of being.
  - 这似乎不可能。他看到从黑暗深渊中降下的不是人类。他们是异星人——来自另一个世界，另一个维度。滑过这道裂缝，穿过宇宙壳的裂缝。从这个缝隙进入，来自另一个存在领域的有翼昆虫。

  ---
  - On the steps of the City Hall a group of men broke up. A few moved toward a waiting car. One of the remaining shapes started to re-enter the City Hall. It changed its mind and turned to follow the others.
  - 在市政厅台阶上，一群男子散开了。有几个人朝一辆等候的车走去。剩下的其中一个身影开始重新进入市政厅。它改变主意，转身跟随其他人。

  ---
  - Loyce closed his eyes in horror. His senses reeled. He hung on tight, clutching at the sagging fence. The shape, the man-shape, had abruptly fluttered up and flapped after the others. It flew to the sidewalk and came to rest among them.
  - 洛伊斯惊恐地闭上了眼睛。他的感官一阵混乱。他紧紧抓住下垂的围栏。那个人形的形态突然扑腾起来，跟着其他的飞扑翅膀。它飞到人行道上，停在他们中间。

  ---
  - Pseudo-men. Imitation men. Insects with ability to disguise themselves as men. Like other insects familiar to Earth. Protective coloration. Mimicry.
  - 伪男人。模仿者。昆虫能伪装成人类。就像地球上其他熟悉的昆虫一样。保护色素。模仿。

  ---
  - Loyce pulled himself away. He got slowly to his feet. It was night. The alley was totally dark. But maybe they could see in the dark. Maybe darkness made no difference to them.
  - 洛伊斯挣脱了距离。他慢慢站起身。那是夜晚。巷子里一片漆黑。但也许他们能在黑暗中看见。也许黑暗对他们毫无影响。

  ---
  - He left the alley cautiously and moved out onto the street. Men and women flowed past, but not so many, now. At the bus stops stood waiting groups. A huge bus lumbered along the street, its lights flashing in the evening gloom.
  - 他小心翼翼地离开小巷，走到街上。男女陆续涌过，但现在已经不多了。公交车站处站着等待的队伍。一辆巨大的公交车缓缓驶过街道，灯光在暮色中闪烁。

  ---
  - Loyce moved forward. He pushed his way among those waiting and when the bus halted he boarded it and took a seat in the rear, by the door. A moment later the bus moved into life and rumbled down the street.
  - 洛伊斯继续前进。他挤过等候的人群，等公交车停下后，他上了车，坐在后排，靠门的位置。片刻后，公交车启动，隆隆地沿着街道驶下。

  ---
  - Loyce relaxed a little. He studied the people around him. Dulled, tired faces. People going home from work. Quite ordinary faces. None of them paid any attention to him. All sat quietly, sunk down in their seats, jiggling with the motion of the bus. The man sitting next to him unfolded a newspaper. He began to read the sports section, his lips moving. An ordinary man. Blue suit. Tie. A businessman, or a salesman. On his way home to his wife and family.
  - 洛伊斯稍微放松了一些。他观察着周围的人。暗淡、疲惫的脸庞。有人下班回家。相当普通的面孔。他们都没理会他。所有人都安静地坐着，坐在座位上，随着公交车的晃动晃动。坐在他旁边的男人展开了一份报纸。他开始阅读体育版块，嘴唇微微动着。一个普通人。蓝色西装。领带。商人，或者推销员。他正回家，和妻子家人在一起。

  ---
  - Across the aisle a young woman, perhaps twenty. Dark eyes and hair, a package on her lap. Nylons and heels. Red coat and white Angora sweater. Gazing absently ahead of her.
  - 过道对面坐着一位大约二十岁的年轻女子。深邃的眼睛和头发，膝上放着一个包裹。丝袜和高跟鞋。红色外套和白色安哥拉毛衣。心不在焉地望着前方。

  ---
  - A high school boy in jeans and black jacket.
  - 一个穿牛仔裤和黑色夹克的高中男孩。

  ---
  - A great triple-chinned woman with an immense shopping bag loaded with packages and parcels. Her thick face dim with weariness. Ordinary people. The kind that rode the bus every evening. Going home to their families. To dinner.
  - 一个三下巴的漂亮女人，背着装满包裹和包裹的大购物袋。她厚实的脸因疲惫而黯淡。普通人。那种每天晚上都坐公交车的人。回家见家人。去吃晚饭。

  ---
  - Going home—with their minds dead. Controlled, filmed over with the mask of an alien being that had appeared and taken possession of them, their town, their lives. Himself, too. Except that he happened to be deep in his cellar instead of in the store. Somehow, he had been overlooked. They had missed him. Their control wasn't perfect, foolproof.
  - 回家——心智已死。被控制，被一个外星生物的面具覆盖，这个存在出现并占据了他们、他们的小镇和生命。他自己也是。只是他恰好在地窖深处，而不是在商店里。不知怎的，他被忽视了。他们很想念他。他们的控制并不完美，也不是万无一失。

  ---
  - Maybe there were others.
  - 也许还有其他人。

  ---
  - Hope flickered in Loyce. They weren't omnipotent. They had made a mistake, not got control of him. Their net, their field of control, had passed over him. He had emerged from his cellar as he had gone down. Apparently their power-zone was limited. A few seats down the aisle a man was watching him. Loyce broke off his chain of thought. A slender man, with dark hair and a small mustache. Well-dressed, brown suit and shiny shoes. A book between his small hands. He was watching Loyce, studying him intently. He turned quickly away.
  - 洛伊斯心中闪现出一丝希望。他们并非全能。他们犯了错，没有控制他。他们的网，他们的控制场，已经越过了他。他从地窖出来，正好下去。显然他们的权力范围有限。过道几排外，有个男人在看他。洛伊斯打断了思绪。一个身材瘦削、黑发、留着小胡子的男人。穿着讲究，棕色西装，鞋子闪亮。小手中夹着一本书。他注视着洛伊斯，专注地打量着他。他迅速转身离开。

  ---
  - Loyce tensed. One of them? Or—another they had missed?
  - 洛伊斯紧张起来。其中一个？或者——又是他们错过的？

  ---
  - The man was watching him again. Small dark eyes, alive and clever. Shrewd. A man too shrewd for them—or one of the things itself, an alien insect from beyond.
  - 那人又在看他。小巧的黑眼睛，生机勃勃，聪明。精明。一个比他们更精明的人——或者是某种东西本身，一个来自彼岸的外星昆虫。

  ---
  - The bus halted. An elderly man got on slowly and dropped his token into the box. He moved down the aisle and took a seat opposite Loyce.
  - 公交车停了下来。一位老人慢慢上车，把他的代币放进了箱子里。他走过过道，坐在洛伊斯对面。

  ---
  - The elderly man caught the sharp-eyed man's gaze. For a split second something passed between them. A look rich with meaning.
  - 老人捕捉到了这位锐利眼神的目光。一瞬间，他们之间闪过一丝什么。那是一种充满意义的目光。

  ---
  - Loyce got to his feet. The bus was moving. He ran to the door. One step down into the well. He yanked the emergency door release. The rubber door swung open.
  - 洛伊斯站了起来。公交车在动。他跑向门口。往井里走一步。他猛地拉开紧急门的释放按钮。橡胶门被推开了。

  ---
  - "Hey!" the driver shouted, jamming on the brakes. "What the hell—?"
  - "喂！"司机喊道，猛踩刹车。"这到底是怎么回事——？"

  ---
  - Loyce squirmed through. The bus was slowing down. Houses on all sides. A residential district, lawns and tall apartment buildings. Behind him, the bright-eyed man had leaped up. The elderly man was also on his feet. They were coming after him. Loyce leaped. He hit the pavement with terrific force and rolled against the curb. Pain lapped over him. Pain and a vast tide of blackness. Desperately, he fought it off. He struggled to his knees and then slid down again. The bus had stopped. People were getting off.
  - 洛伊斯挤过去。公交车开始减速。四周都是房屋。一个住宅区，草坪和高层公寓楼。他身后，那个眼睛明亮的男人跳了起来。老人也站了起来。他们正在追捕他。洛伊斯跳了起来。他用极大的力量撞击地面，滚到了路缘边。疼痛袭来。痛苦和一片黑暗的潮水。他拼命抵抗。他挣扎着跪起，然后又滑了下去。公交车停了下来。人们下车了。

  ---
  - Loyce groped around. His fingers closed over something. A rock, lying in the gutter. He crawled to his feet, grunting with pain. A shape loomed before him. A man, the bright-eyed man with the book.
  - 洛伊斯摸索着。他的手指握住了什么东西。一块石头，躺在沟里。他爬起身，痛苦地咕哝着。一个身影在他面前显现。一个男人，那个眼睛明亮、拿着书的男人。

  ---
  - Loyce kicked. The man gasped and fell. Loyce brought the rock down. The man screamed and tried to roll away. "Stop! For God's sake listen—"
  - 洛伊斯踢了一脚。那人倒吸一口气，跌倒了。洛伊斯把石头放下了。那人尖叫着试图翻滚逃跑。"停下！看在上帝的份上，听我说——"

  ---
  - He struck again. A hideous crunching sound. The man's voice cut off and dissolved in a bubbling wail. Loyce scrambled up and back. The others were there, now. All around him. He ran, awkwardly, down the sidewalk, up a driveway. None of them followed him. They had stopped and were bending over the inert body of the man with the book, the bright-eyed man who had come after him.
  - 他又出手了。一声可怕的碎裂声。那人的声音戛然而止，化为一声翻腾的哀号。洛伊斯慌忙爬上又回来。其他人现在都在那里。四周都是。他笨拙地沿着人行道跑上车道。他们都没跟上他。他们停下，弯腰看着那个拿着书的男人的无力身体，那个眼睛明亮的男人，跟着他走来。

  ---
  - Had he made a mistake?
  - 他是不是犯了错？

  ---
  - But it was too late to worry about that. He had to get out—away from them. Out of Pikeville, beyond the crack of darkness, the rent between their world and his.
  - 但现在担心这些已经太晚了。他必须离开——远离他们。离开派克维尔，穿越黑暗的裂缝，那是他们世界与他世界之间的裂缝。

  ---
  - "Ed!" Janet Loyce backed away nervously. "What is it? What—"
  - "艾德！"珍妮特·洛伊斯紧张地后退。"怎么了？什么——"

  ---
  - Ed Loyce slammed the door behind him and came into the living room. "Pull down the shades. Quick." Janet moved toward the window. "But—"
  - 埃德·洛伊斯砰地关上门，走进客厅。"拉下窗帘。快点。"珍妮特走向窗户。"但是——"

  ---
  - "Do as I say. Who else is here besides you?"
  - "照我说的做。除了你，还有谁？"

  ---
  - "Nobody. Just the twins. They're upstairs in their room. What's happened? You look so strange. Why are you home?"
  - "没人。只有双胞胎。他们在楼上的房间里。发生了什么？你看起来真奇怪。你怎么回来了？"

  ---
  - Ed locked the front door. He prowled around the house, into the kitchen. From the drawer under the sink he slid out the big butcher knife and ran his finger along it. Sharp. Plenty sharp. He returned to the living room.
  - 埃德锁上了前门。他在屋子里徘徊，进了厨房。他从水槽下的抽屉里抽出一把大屠刀，用手指划过。锐利。非常锋利。他回到客厅。

  ---
  - "Listen to me," he said. "I don't have much time. They know I escaped and they'll be looking for me."
  - "听我说，"他说。"我没多少时间了。他们知道我逃出来了，会一直找我。"

  ---
  - "Escaped?" Janet's face twisted with bewilderment and fear. "Who?"
  - "逃跑了？"珍妮特的脸上满是困惑和恐惧。"谁？"

  ---
  - "The town has been taken over. They're in control. I've got it pretty well figured out. They started at the top, at the City Hall and police department. What they did with the real humans they—"
  - "镇子被占领了。他们掌控一切。我已经很清楚了。他们从市政厅和警察局的顶层开始。他们对真正的人类做了什么——"

  ---
  - "What are you talking about?"
  - "你在说什么？"

  ---
  - "We've been invaded. From some other universe, some other dimension. They're insects. Mimicry. And more. Power to control minds. Your mind."
  - "我们被入侵了。来自另一个宇宙，另一个维度。它们是昆虫。模仿。还有更多。控制心灵的力量。你的心灵。"

  ---
  - "My mind?"
  - "我的心灵？"

  ---
  - "Their entrance is here, in Pikeville. They've taken over all of you. The whole town—except me. We're up against an incredibly powerful enemy, but they have their limitations. That's our hope. They're limited! They can make mistakes!" Janet shook her head. "I don't understand, Ed. You must be insane."
  - "他们的入口就在这里，派克维尔。他们已经控制了你们所有人。整个镇子——除了我。我们面对的是一个极其强大的敌人，但他们也有局限。这是我们的希望。它们数量有限！他们会犯错！"珍妮特摇了摇头。"我不明白，埃德。你一定疯了。"

  ---
  - "Insane? No. Just lucky. If I hadn't been down in the basement I'd be like all the rest of you." Loyce peered out the window. "But I can't stand here talking. Get your coat."
  - "疯了？不。只是运气好。如果我没在地下室，我早就和你们其他人一样了。"洛伊斯望向窗外。"但我不能站在这里说话。拿上你的外套。"

  ---
  - "My coat?"
  - "我的外套？"

  ---
  - "We're getting out of here. Out of Pikeville. We've got to get help. Fight this thing. They can be beaten. They're not infallible. It's going to be close—but we may make it if we hurry. Come on!" He grabbed her arm roughly. "Get your coat and call the twins. We're all leaving. Don't stop to pack. There's no time for that."
  - "我们得离开这里。从派克维尔出来。我们得去寻求帮助。抗争这东西。他们是可以被打败的。他们并非万无一失。比赛会很紧张——但如果我们快点，或许能赶上。快点！"他粗暴地抓住她的手臂。"穿上外套，叫双胞胎。我们都要走了。别停下来收拾东西。没时间了。"

  ---
  - White-faced, his wife moved toward the closet and got down her coat. "Where are we going?"
  - 脸色发白，妻子走向衣橱，脱下外套。"我们要去哪儿？"

  ---
  - Ed pulled open the desk drawer and spilled the contents out onto the floor. He grabbed up a road map and spread it open. "They'll have the highway covered, of course. But there's a back road. To Oak Grove. I got onto it once. It's practically abandoned. Maybe they'll forget about it."
  - 埃德拉开书桌抽屉，把东西洒在地上。他拿起一张路线图，摊开。"他们当然会把高速公路都覆盖好。但有条小路。去橡树林。我曾经接触过一次。几乎是废弃的。也许他们会忘了这事。"

  ---
  - "The old Ranch Road? Good Lord—it's completely closed. Nobody's supposed to drive over it."
  - "老牧场路？天哪——完全关门了。没人应该开车越过它。"

  ---
  - "I know." Ed thrust the map grimly into his coat. "That's our best chance. Now call down the twins and let's get going. Your car is full of gas, isn't it?"
  - "我知道。"埃德阴沉地把地图塞进外套里。"那是我们最好的机会。现在叫双胞胎下来，我们出发。你的车里油是不是满的？"

  ---
  - Janet was dazed.珍妮特有些恍惚。

  ---
  - "The Chevy? I had it filled up yesterday afternoon." Janet moved toward the stairs. "Ed, I—"
  - "雪佛兰？我昨天下午已经加满了。"珍妮特朝楼梯走去。"艾德，我——"

  ---
  - "Call the twins!" Ed unlocked the front door and peered out. Nothing stirred. No sign of life. All right so far.
  - "叫双胞胎！"埃德打开前门，往外看。什么都没动。没有生命迹象。到目前为止还行。

  ---
  - "Come on downstairs," Janet called in a wavering voice. "We're—going out for a while."
  - "快下来，"珍妮特声音颤抖地喊道。"我们——出去一会儿。"

  ---
  - "Now?" Tommy's voice came.
  - "现在？"汤米的声音响起。

  ---
  - "Hurry up," Ed barked. "Get down here, both of you."
  - "快点，"埃德厉声说道。"你们俩都下来。"

  ---
  - Tommy appeared at the top of the stairs. "I was doing my homework. We're starting fractions. Miss Parker says if we don't get this done—"
  - 汤米出现在楼梯顶端。"我在做作业。我们开始分段。帕克小姐说如果我们不完成这件事——"

  ---
  - "You can forget about fractions." Ed grabbed his son as he came down the stairs and propelled him toward the door. "Where's Jim?"
  - "分数你可以忘了。"埃德在儿子下楼时抓住他，推他朝门口走去。"吉姆在哪儿？"

  ---
  - "He's coming."
  - "他来了。"

  ---
  - Jim started slowly down the stairs. "What's up, Dad?"
  - 吉姆慢慢下楼。"怎么了，爸爸？"

  ---
  - "We're going for a ride."
  - "我们要去兜风。"

  ---
  - "A ride? Where?"
  - "搭便车？在哪里？"

  ---
  - Ed turned to Janet. "We'll leave the lights on. And the TV set. Go turn it on." He pushed her toward the set. "So they'll think we're still—"
  - 埃德转向珍妮特。"我们会开灯。还有电视机。去打开它。"他推着她走向片场。"所以他们会以为我们还是——"

  ---
  - He heard the buzz. And dropped instantly, the long butcher knife out. Sickened, he saw it coming down the stairs at him, wings a blur of motion as it aimed itself. It still bore a vague resemblance to Jimmy. It was small, a baby one. A brief glimpse—the thing hurtling at him, cold, multi-lensed inhuman eyes. Wings, body still clothed in yellow T-shirt and jeans, the mimic outline still stamped on it. A strange half-turn of its body as it reached him. What was it doing?
  - 他听到了嗡嗡声。然后立刻掉落，长刀拔出。他感到恶心，看到它从楼梯上冲过来，翅膀一阵模糊地朝他瞄准。它依然和吉米有些模糊的相似。它很小，是个婴儿。一瞥——那个朝他飞来的东西，冰冷、多重镜片的非人类眼睛。翅膀，身体还穿着黄色T恤和牛仔裤，模仿者的轮廓还印在上面。它身体奇怪地转了半圈，走近他。它在做什么？

  ---
  - A stinger.
  - 一根刺。

  ---
  - Loyce stabbed wildly at it. It retreated, buzzing frantically. Loyce rolled and crawled toward the door. Tommy and Janet stood still as statues, faces blank. Watching without expression. Loyce stabbed again. This time the knife connected. The thing shrieked and faltered. It bounced against the wall and fluttered down.
  - 洛伊斯疯狂地刺向它。它疯狂地嗡嗡作响地退了回去。洛伊斯翻滚着，爬向门口。汤米和珍妮特像雕像一样一动不动，脸上没有表情。无表情地注视着。洛伊斯又刺了一刀。这次刀子击中了。那东西尖叫着，踉跄了一下。它撞击墙壁，然后扑腾着落下。

  ---

  ---
  - Something lapped through his mind. A wall of force, energy, an alien mind probing into him. He was suddenly paralyzed. The mind entered his own, touched against him briefly, shockingly. An utter alien presence, settling over him—and then it flickered out as the thing collapsed in a broken heap on the rug.
  - 有什么东西在他脑海中掠过。一堵力量之墙，能量，一个外星意识在探查他。他突然瘫痪了。意识进入了他的心灵，短暂地触碰了他，令人震惊。一种完全陌生的存在笼罩着他——然后它在地毯上崩塌成一团破碎的存在，闪烁着消灭。

  ---
  - It was dead. He turned it over with his foot. It was an insect, a fly of some kind. Yellow T-shirt, jeans. His son Jimmy... He closed his mind tight. It was too late to think about that. Savagely he scooped up his knife and headed toward the door. Janet and Tommy stood stone-still, neither of them moving.
  - 它死了。他用脚把它翻了个身。那是一只昆虫，某种苍蝇。黄色T恤，牛仔裤。他的儿子吉米......他紧闭心扉。现在想这些已经太晚了。他愤怒地抓起刀，朝门口走去。珍妮特和汤米一动不动，谁也没有动。

  ---
  - The car was out. He'd never get through. They'd be waiting for him. It was ten miles on foot. Ten long miles over rough ground, gulleys and open fields and hills of uncut forest. He'd have to go alone.
  - 车坏了。他永远也打不过去。他们会等着他。步行要十英里。十英里漫长的路程，穿越崎岖的地形、峡谷、开阔的田野和未被砍伐的森林丘陵。他得一个人去。

  ---
  - Loyce opened the door. For a brief second he looked back at his wife and son. Then he slammed the door behind him and raced down the porch steps.
  - 洛伊斯打开了门。他短暂地回头看了看妻子和儿子。然后他砰地关上门，飞快地跑下门廊的台阶。

  ---
  - A moment later he was on his way, hurrying swiftly through the darkness toward the edge of town.
  - 片刻后，他便匆匆穿过黑暗，朝镇边走去。

  ---
  - The early morning sunlight was blinding. Loyce halted, gasping for breath, swaying back and forth. Sweat ran down in his eyes. His clothing was torn, shredded by the brush and thorns through which he had crawled. Ten miles—on his hands and knees. Crawling, creeping through the night. His shoes were mud-caked. He was scratched and limping, utterly exhausted. But ahead of him lay Oak Grove.
  - 清晨的阳光刺眼。洛伊斯停下脚步，喘着气，身体前后摇晃。汗水顺着他的眼睛滑落。他的衣服被灌木和荆棘撕裂，被他爬过的荆棘撕裂。十英里——用手和膝盖爬行。爬行，在夜色中悄悄爬行。他的鞋子沾满了泥。他满身抓痕，跛行，彻底疲惫不堪。但眼前是橡树林。

  ---
  - He took a deep breath and started down the hill. Twice he stumbled and fell, picking himself up and trudging on. His ears rang. Everything receded and wavered. But he was there. He had got out, away from Pikeville.
  - 他深吸一口气，开始下山。他两次跌倒，挣扎着继续前行。他的耳朵嗡嗡作响。一切都退去，摇摆不定。但他确实在那里。他已经逃出去，远离了派克维尔。

  ---
  - A farmer in a field gaped at him. From a house a young woman watched in wonder. Loyce reached the road and turned onto it. Ahead of him was a gasoline station and a drive-in. A couple of trucks, some chickens pecking in the dirt, a dog tied with a string.
  - 田里的农夫目瞪口呆地看着他。一位年轻女子在一所房子里惊奇地注视着。洛伊斯走到马路边，转上了路。他面前是一个加油站和一家汽车影院。几辆卡车，几只鸡在泥土里啄食，一只用绳子绑着的狗。

  ---
  - The white-clad attendant watched suspiciously as he dragged himself up to the station. "Thank God." He caught hold of the wall. "I didn't think I was going to make it. They followed me most of the way. I could hear them buzzing. Buzzing and flitting around behind me."
  - 身穿白衣的工作人员怀疑地看着他拖着自己走向车站。"谢天谢地。"他抓住了墙壁。"我没想到我能挺过去。他们大部分路程都跟着我。我能听到它们嗡嗡作响。在我身后嗡嗡飞舞。"

  ---
  - "What happened?" the attendant demanded. "You in a wreck? A holdup?"
  - "发生了什么？"侍者质问。"你出事了吗？抢劫？"

  ---
  - Loyce shook his head wearily. "They have the whole town. The City Hall and the police station. They hung a man from the lamppost. That was the first thing I saw. They've got all the roads blocked. I saw them hovering over the cars coming in. About four this morning I got beyond them. I knew it right away. I could feel them leave. And then the sun came up."
  - 洛伊斯疲惫地摇了摇头。"他们掌控了整个镇子。市政厅和警察局。他们把一个人吊在路灯柱上。那是我看到的第一件事。他们把所有路都封锁了。我看到他们在驶入的车辆上方盘旋。今天凌晨四点左右，我越过了它们。我立刻就知道了。我能感觉到他们离开了。然后太阳升起了。"

  ---
  - The attendant licked his lip nervously. "You're out of your head. I better get a doctor."
  - 服务员紧张地舔了舔嘴唇。"你疯了。我最好去找医生。"

  ---
  - "Get me into Oak Grove," Loyce gasped. He sank down on the gravel. "We've got to get started—cleaning them out. Got to get started right away."
  - "带我进橡树林，"洛伊斯喘息着说。他坐在碎石上。"我们得开始了——清理它们。得马上开始。"

  ---
  - They kept a tape recorder going all the time he talked. When he had finished the Commissioner snapped off the recorder and got to his feet. He stood for a moment, deep in thought. Finally he got out his cigarettes and lit up slowly, a frown on his beefy face.
  - 他说话的时候，他们一直开着录音机。说完后，专员啪地关掉录音机，站了起来。他站了一会儿，陷入沉思。终于他掏出香烟，慢慢点燃，厚实的脸上带着皱眉。

  ---
  - "You don't believe me," Loyce said.
  - "你不相信我，"洛伊斯说。

  ---
  - The Commissioner offered him a cigarette. Loyce pushed it impatiently away. "Suit yourself." The Commissioner moved over to the window and stood for a time looking out at the town of Oak Grove. "I believe you," he said abruptly.
  - 专员递给他一根烟。洛伊斯不耐烦地把它推开。"随你便。"专员走到窗边，站了一会儿，望着橡树林镇。"我相信你，"他突然说。

  ---
  - Loyce sagged. "Thank God."
  - 洛伊斯垂下了肩膀。"谢天谢地。"

  ---
  - "So you got away." The Commissioner shook his head. "You were down in your cellar instead of at work. A freak chance. One in a million."
  - "所以你逃掉了。"专员摇了摇头。"你当时在地窖里，而不是在工作。一个罕见的机会。百万分之一。"

  ---
  - Loyce sipped some of the black coffee they had brought him. "I have a theory," he murmured.
  - 洛伊斯啜饮着他们带来的黑咖啡。"我有个理论，"他低声说。

  ---
  - "What is it?"
  - "怎么了？"

  ---
  - "About them. Who they are. They take over one area at a time. Starting at the top—the highest level of authority. Working down from there in a widening circle. When they're firmly in control they go on to the next town. They spread, slowly, very gradually. I think it's been going on for a long time."
  - "关于他们。他们是谁。他们一次接管一个区域。从最高层开始——最高权威层级。从那里开始，沿着一个逐渐扩大的圆环推进。当他们牢牢掌控局面时，他们会前往下一个城镇。它们慢慢地、非常缓慢地扩散开来。我觉得这已经持续很久了。"

  ---
  - "A long time?"
  - "很久了？"

  ---
  - "Thousands of years. I don't think it's new."
  - "几千年了。我觉得这并不新鲜。"

  ---
  - "Why do you say that?"
  - "你为什么这么说？"

  ---
  - "When I was a kid... A picture they showed us in Bible League. A religious picture—an old print. The enemy gods, defeated by Jehovah. Moloch, Beelzebub, Moab, Baalin, Ashtaroth—"
  - "我小时候......这是他们在圣经联盟里给我们看的照片。一幅宗教画——一幅老版画。敌对的神明，被耶和华击败。摩洛克、别西卜、摩押、巴林、亚斯他罗——"

  ---
  - "So?"
  - "那又怎样？"

  ---
  - "They were all represented by figures." Loyce looked up at the Commissioner. "Beelzebub was represented as—a giant fly."
  - "他们都被人形代表。"洛伊斯抬头看着局长。"别西卜被描绘成——一只巨大的苍蝇。"

  ---
  - The Commissioner grunted. "An old struggle."
  - 专员咕哝了一声。"一场旧争斗。"

  ---
  - "They've been defeated. The Bible is an account of their defeats. They make gains—but finally they're defeated."
  - "他们被击败了。圣经是他们失败的记载。他们取得了进展——但最终还是被击败了。"

  ---
  - "Why defeated?"
  - "为什么会被击败？"

  ---
  - "They can't get everyone. They didn't get me. And they never got the Hebrews. The Hebrews carried the message to the whole world. The realization of the danger. The two men on the bus. I think they understood. Had escaped, like I did." He clenched his fists. "I killed one of them. I made a mistake. I was afraid to take a chance."
  - "他们不可能抓到所有人。他们没抓到我。他们从未得到希伯来人。希伯来人将这个信息传给了全世界。意识到危险。公交车上的两个男人。我觉得他们理解了。逃脱了，就像我一样。"他握紧拳头。"我杀了其中一个。我犯了个错误。我害怕冒险。"

  ---
  - The Commissioner nodded. "Yes, they undoubtedly had escaped, as you did. Freak accidents. But the rest of the town was firmly in control." He turned from the window, "Well, Mr. Loyce. You seem to have figured everything out."
  - 专员点了点头。"是的，他们无疑逃脱了，就像你一样。意外。但镇上其他人牢牢掌控着局面。"他从窗边转过身，"好吧，洛伊斯先生。你似乎已经把一切都弄明白了。"

  ---
  - "Not everything. The hanging man. The dead man hanging from the lamppost. I don't understand that. Why? Why did they deliberately hang him there?"
  - "不是全部。绞刑犯。吊在路灯杆上的死者。我不明白。为什么？他们为什么故意把他吊在那里？"

  ---
  - "That would seem simple." The Commissioner smiled faintly. "Bait."
  - "这看起来很简单。"专员微微一笑。"诱饵。"

  ---
  - Loyce stiffened. His heart stopped beating. "Bait? What do you mean?"
  - 洛伊斯僵住了。他的心停止跳动。"诱饵？你什么意思？"

  ---
  - "To draw you out. Make you declare yourself. So they'd know who was under control—and who had escaped."
  - "引你出来。让你表明身份。这样他们才能知道谁被控制住了——谁逃脱了。"

  ---
  - Loyce recoiled with horror. "Then they expected failures! They anticipated—" He broke off. "They were ready with a trap." "And you showed yourself. You reacted. You made yourself known." The Commissioner abruptly moved toward the door. "Come along, Loyce. There's a lot to do. We must get moving. There's no time to waste."
  - 洛伊斯惊恐地后退。"那他们就预料失败了！他们预料到了——"他话锋一转，"他们已经准备好了陷阱。""你现身了。你做出了反应。你已经让自己被注意到了。"专员突然朝门口走去。"走吧，洛伊斯。有很多事情要做。我们得赶紧行动。没时间浪费了。"

  - Loyce started slowly to his feet, numbed. "And the man. Who was the man? I never saw him before. He wasn't a local man. He was a stranger. All muddy and dirty, his face cut, slashed—"
  - 洛伊斯慢慢站起身，麻木着。"还有那个人。那个人是谁？我以前从没见过他。他不是本地人。他是个陌生人。满身泥泞肮脏，脸被划破——"

  ---
  - There was a strange look on the Commissioner's face as he answered, "Maybe," he said softly, "you'll understand that, too. Come along with me, Mr. Loyce." He held the door open, his eyes gleaming. Loyce caught a glimpse of the street in front of the police station. Policemen, a platform of some sort. A telephone pole—and a rope! "Right this way," the Commissioner said, smiling coldly.
  - 局长脸上露出奇怪的表情回答："也许吧，"他轻声说，"你也会明白的。跟我来，洛伊斯先生。"他扶着门，眼睛闪闪发光。洛伊斯瞥见警察局前的街道。警察，某种平台。一根电线杆——还有一根绳子！"这边请，"专员冷冷地笑着说。

  ---
  - As the sun set, the vice-president of the Oak Grove Merchants' Bank came up out of the vault, threw the heavy time locks, put on his hat and coat, and hurried outside onto the sidewalk. Only a few people were there, hurrying home to dinner.
  - 夕阳西下时，橡树林商人银行的副行长从金库走出来，扔上沉重的时间锁，戴上帽子和外套，匆匆走到人行道上。只有少数几个人匆匆回家吃晚饭。

  ---
  - "Good night," the guard said, locking the door after him.
  - "晚安，"守卫说着，锁上了门。

  ---
  - "Good night," Clarence Mason murmured. He started along the street toward his car. He was tired. He had been working all day down in the vault, examining the lay-out of the safety deposit boxes to see if there was room for another tier. He was glad to be finished.
  - "晚安，"克拉伦斯·梅森低声说。他沿着街道朝自己的车走去。他累了。他整天都在金库里工作，检查保险箱的布局，看看是否还有空间放下一层。他很高兴终于完成了。

  ---
  - At the corner he halted. The street lights had not yet come on. The street was dim. Everything was vague. He looked around—and froze.
  - 在拐角处他停下了脚步。路灯还没亮。街道昏暗。一切都很模糊。他环顾四周——然后僵住了。

  ---
  - From the telephone pole in front of the police station, something large and shapeless hung. It moved a little with the wind. What the hell was it?
  - 从警察局前的电话杆上，挂着一个巨大而无形的东西。它随风微微晃动。到底是什么？

  ---
  - Mason approached it warily. He wanted to get home. He was tired and hungry. He thought of his wife, his kids, a hot meal on the dinner table. But there was something about the dark bundle, something ominous and ugly.
  - 梅森小心翼翼地走近。他想回家。他又累又饿。他想着妻子、孩子们，餐桌上的热饭。但那个黑暗包裹身上有种不祥和丑陋的气息。

  ---
  - The light was bad; he couldn't tell what it was. Yet it drew him on, made him move closer for a better look. The shapeless thing made him uneasy. He was frightened by it. Frightened—and fascinated.
  - 光线很差;他分不清那是什么。然而这又吸引了他，让他靠近，想看得更清楚。那无形的东西让他感到不安。他害怕它。害怕——又着迷。

  ---
  - And the strange part was that nobody else seemed to notice it.
  - 奇怪的是，似乎没有其他人注意到这一点。

Part I第一部分

Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnum Villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess; the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical chances, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.
外面夜晚寒冷潮湿，但在拉伯南别墅的小客厅里，百叶窗拉上，火焰熊熊燃烧。父子俩都下棋;前者对游戏充满激进机会的看法，把国王置于极端且不必要的危险中，甚至引得那位白发老太太在火炉旁安静地编织，发出了评论。

"Hark at the wind," said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.
"注意风向，"怀特先生说，他在为时已晚后看到致命错误，友好地希望阻止儿子看到。

"I'm listening," said the latter, grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. "Check."
"我在听，"后者说，阴沉地打量着棋盘，伸出手。"检查。"

"I should hardly think he'll come to-night," said his father, with his hand poised over the board.
"我几乎不认为他今晚会来，"父亲说，手悬在黑板上。

"Mate," replied the son.
"伙计，"儿子回答。

"That's the worst of living so far out," bawled Mr. White, with sudden and unlooked-for violence. "Of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way places to live in, this is the worst. Path's a bog, and the road's a torrent. I don't know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter."
"活得这么远最糟糕，"怀特先生突然且意想不到地怒吼。"在所有肮脏、泥泞、偏僻的地方里，这里是最糟糕的。小路是泥沼，路是激流。我不知道大家在想什么。我想是因为路上只有两栋房子出租，他们觉得没什么大不了的。"

"Never mind, dear," said his wife soothingly; "perhaps you'll win the next one."
"没关系，亲爱的，"妻子温柔地说;"也许你会赢下一场。"

Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. The words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.
怀特先生猛地抬头，正好在母子间捕捉到一记心照不宣的眼神。话语在他嘴边消失，他把一抹愧疚的笑藏在细长的灰胡子里。

"There he is," said Herbert White, as the gate banged too loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.
"他来了，"赫伯特·怀特说，门砰地一声撞上，沉重的脚步声朝门口走来。

The old man rose with hospitable haste, and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, "Tut, tut!" and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.
老人热情地起身，打开门时，听到有人在向新来者致意。新来者也自怜自慰，怀特夫人说了句"啧啧！"并轻咳一声，丈夫随后跟着一个高大魁梧、眼珠闪亮、脸色红润的男子走进房间。

"Sergeant-Major Morris," he said, introducing him.
"莫里斯军士长，"他介绍道。

The Sergeant-Major took hands, and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly as his host got out whisky and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.
军士长握住手，坐在火炉旁的座位上，满足地看着主人拿出威士忌和杯子，把一个小铜壶放在火上。

At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds—of wars and plagues and strange peoples.
喝到第三杯时，他的眼睛变得明亮起来，开始说话，小家庭圈子里远方的访客满怀兴趣地看着他，他挺直宽阔的肩膀坐在椅子上，讲述着狂野的场景和英勇的事迹——战争、瘟疫和奇异的民族。

"Twenty-one years of it," said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. "When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him."
"二十一年了，"怀特先生点头示意妻子和儿子。"他离开时，在仓库里还是个瘦弱的年轻人。现在看看他。"

"He doesn't look to have taken much harm," said Mrs. White politely.
"他看起来没受什么大伤，"怀特夫人礼貌地说。

"I'd like to go to India myself," said the old man, "just to look around a bit, you know."
"我自己也想去印度，"老人说，"只是想四处看看，你知道的。"

"Better where you are," said the Sergeant-Major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass and sighing softly, shook it again.
"你在这儿更好，"军士长摇头说。他放下空杯，轻轻叹气，又摇了摇杯子。

"I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers," said the old man. "What was that you started telling me the other day about a monkey's paw or something, Morris?"
"我倒想看看那些老庙宇、苦行僧和杂耍者，"老人说。"莫里斯，你前几天开始跟我说猴爪什么的？"

"Nothing," said the soldier hastily. "Leastways, nothing worth hearing."
"没什么，"士兵急忙说。"至少，没什么值得听的。"

"Monkey's paw?" said Mrs. White curiously.
"猴爪？"怀特夫人好奇地问。

"Well, it's just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps," said the Sergeant-Major off-handedly.
"嗯，这大概就是你们所谓的魔法吧，"军士长漫不经心地说。

His three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him once more.
他的三位听众兴奋地向前倾身。访客心不在焉地把空杯子放到嘴边，又放下了。他的主人又为他倒满了酒。

"To look at," said the Sergeant-Major, fumbling in his pocket, "it's just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy."
"看着，"军士长一边在口袋里摸索一边说，"这只是一只普通的小爪子，干成木乃伊了。"

He took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.
他从口袋里掏出一样东西递了过去。怀特夫人皱着眉退了回去，但她的儿子接过手，好奇地打量着。

"And what is there special about it?" inquired Mr. White, as he took it from his son and, having examined it, placed it upon the table.
"那它有什么特别的？"怀特先生一边从儿子手中接过信纸，一边检查后放在桌上，问道。

"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir," said the Sergeant-Major, "a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it."
"那是个老苦行僧对它施了魔法，"军士长说，"一个非常圣洁的人。他想表明命运主宰着人们的生活，而那些干涉命运的人，都是让他们感到悲伤。他对它施了魔法，让三个不同的人各自可以从中得到三个愿望。"

His manner was so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter had jarred somewhat.
他的举止令人印象深刻，听众都意识到了，轻笑声有些震惊。

"Well, why don't you have three, sir?" said Herbert White cleverly.
"那您为什么不喝三杯呢，先生？"赫伯特·怀特机智地说。

The soldier regarded him the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth. "I have," he said quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.
士兵看他的方式，就像中年人对自负的年轻人的态度。"我见过，"他轻声说，斑驳的脸色变得白皙。

"And did you really have the three wishes granted?" asked Mrs. White.
"你真的实现了三个愿望吗？"怀特夫人问。

"I did," said the Sergeant-Major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.
"我确实说过，"军士长说，酒杯敲击着他坚硬的牙齿。

"And has anybody else wished?" persisted the old lady.
"还有别人想过吗？"老太太坚持问。

"The first man had his three wishes, yes," was the reply; "I don't know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That's how I got the paw."
"第一个人有三个愿望，是的，"回答;"我不知道前两个是什么，但第三个是关于死亡的。我就是靠这个得到那只爪子的。"

His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.
他的语气严肃，令众人顿时安静下来。

"If you've had your three wishes, it's no good to you now then, Morris," said the old man at last. "What do you keep it for?"
"如果你已经实现了三个愿望，那现在对你没用了，莫里斯，"老人终于说道。"你为什么留着？"

The soldier shook his head. "Fancy, I suppose," he said slowly. "I did have some idea of selling it, but I don't think I will. It has caused me enough mischief already. Besides, people won't buy. They think it's a fairy tale, some of them; and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterwards."
士兵摇了摇头。"算是高级吧，"他慢慢说。"我确实有卖掉它的想法，但我想我不会了。这已经给我带来了够多的麻烦了。而且，人们不会买单。他们觉得这是童话故事，有些人;那些觉得有点问题的人，想先试试，然后再付钱给我。"

"If you could have another three wishes," said the old man, eyeing him keenly, "would you have them?"
"如果你能再许三个愿望，"老人锐利地看着他说，"你会想要吗？"

"I don't know," said the other. "I don't know."
"我不知道，"另一个人说。"我不知道。"

He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.
他拿起爪子，用食指和拇指夹着，突然把它扔进火堆里。怀特轻声叫了一声，弯腰抢过了它。

"Better let it burn," said the soldier solemnly.
"还是让它烧掉吧。"士兵郑重地说道。

"If you don't want it, Morris," said the other, "give it to me."
"如果你不想要，莫里斯，"另一个说，"给我吧。"

"I won't," said his friend doggedly. "I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don't blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man."
"我不会的，"他的朋友坚定地说。"我把它扔进了火里。如果你留下了，别怪我发生了什么。像个理智的人一样把它扔进火里。"

The other shook his head and examined his possession closely. "How do you do it?" he inquired.
对方摇头，仔细检查自己的物品。"你是怎么做到的？"他问。

"Hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud," said the Sergeant-Major; "but I warn you of the consequences."
"把它举在右手里，大声许愿，"军士长说;"但我警告你后果。"

"Sounds like the Arabian Nights," said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. "Don't you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me?"
"听起来像《一千零一夜》，"怀特夫人站起身开始摆晚餐时说道。"你难道不觉得你会希望我有四双手吗？"

Her husband drew the talisman from his pocket, and all three burst into laughter as the Sergeant-Major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.
她的丈夫从口袋里掏出护身符，三人都笑了起来，军士长脸上带着惊恐的表情抓住了他的手臂。

"If you must wish," he said gruffly, "wish for something sensible."
"如果你非得许愿，"他粗声说，"许个合理的愿。"

Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second instalment of the soldier's adventures in India.
怀特先生把它放回口袋，摆好椅子，示意朋友坐到桌边。晚餐时，护身符部分被遗忘，之后三人专注地聆听士兵在印度的第二部分冒险故事。

"If the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us," said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time to catch the last train, "we shan't make much out of it."
"如果关于猴子爪子的故事不比他告诉我们的更真实，"赫伯特说，门在客人身后关上，正好赶上末班火车，"我们也没什么大好想。"

"Did you give anything for it, father?" inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.
"父亲，你有为它付出什么吗？"怀特夫人仔细打量着丈夫问道。

"A trifle," said he, colouring slightly. "He didn't want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away."
"小事，"他说，脸色微微泛红。"他本不想，但我让他吃了。他又催我把它扔掉。"

"Likely," said Herbert, with pretended horror. "Why, we're going to be rich, and famous, and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can't be henpecked."
"很可能，"赫伯特假装惊恐地说。"为什么，我们会变得富有、出名、幸福。父亲，一开始就想成为皇帝;那你就不能被管着了。"

He darted round the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs. White armed with an antimacassar.
他绕过桌子，被那个备受诅咒的怀特夫人紧追不舍，手持一把反马卡萨尔。

Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. "I don't know what to wish for, and that's a fact," he said slowly. "It seems to me I've got all I want."
怀特先生从口袋里拿出爪子，怀疑地看着它。"我不知道该许什么愿，这是事实，"他慢慢说。"在我看来，我已经得到了我想要的一切。"

"If you only cleared the house you'd be quite happy, wouldn't you!" said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. "Well, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that'll just do it."
"如果你能把房子清理干净，你会很开心的，不是吗！"赫伯特一边说，一边把手搭在他的肩膀上。"那就许愿两百英镑吧;这就够了。"

His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down and struck a few impressive chords.
父亲羞愧地笑着，举起符箓，儿子面色庄重，脸上带着对母亲的眨眼，坐下敲响了几句令人印象深刻的和弦。

"I wish for two hundred pounds," said the old man distinctly.
"我希望有两百英镑，"老人清晰地说。

A fine crash from the piano greeted his words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.
钢琴发出清脆的撞击声，随即被老人颤抖的呼喊打断。他的妻子和儿子朝他跑来。

"It moved," he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor. "As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake."
"它动了，"他哭喊着，带着厌恶的目光看着躺在地上的物体。"正如我所愿，它在我手中像蛇一样扭动。"

"Well, I don't see the money," said his son, as he picked it up and placed it on the table, "and I bet I never shall."
"嗯，我没看到钱，"儿子一边捡起钱放在桌上一边说，"我敢打赌我永远也看不到。"

"It must have been your fancy, father," said his wife, regarding him anxiously.
"父亲，这一定是您的心血，"妻子焦急地看着他说。

He shook his head. "Never mind, though; there's no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same."
他摇了摇头。"不过算了;没造成什么伤害，但还是让我很震惊。"

They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence, unusual and depressing, settled on all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the rest of the night.
他们又坐在火炉旁，两人完成了烟斗的制作。外面风比以往任何时候都大，老人听到楼上传来敲门声，紧张地吓了一跳。一种罕见而令人沮丧的沉默笼罩着三人，直到老夫妇起身准备休息，直到他们继续休息。

"I expect you'll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed," said Herbert, as he bade them good night, "and something horrible squatting on top of your wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains."
"我猜你们会发现现金被绑在床中央的大袋子里，"赫伯特说着道晚安，"还有什么可怕的东西蹲在你们衣柜顶上，看着你们揣着那些不义之财。"

He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire and seeing faces in it. The last was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.
他独自坐在黑暗中，凝视着渐渐熄灭的火焰，看到里面的面孔。最后一个太可怕、太像猿猴了，他惊讶地盯着它看。画面变得如此鲜明，他带着一丝不安的笑声，摸索着桌上找一个装有点水的杯子泼上去。他握住猴子的爪子，带着一阵颤抖，用外套擦了擦手，然后上床睡觉。

Part II第二部分

In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning, as it streamed over the breakfast table, he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shrivelled little paw was pitched on the sideboard with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.
第二天清晨，冬日阳光洒在早餐桌上，他笑着嘲笑自己的恐惧。房间里弥漫着一种平凡而健康的气息，这是前一晚所缺乏的，那只肮脏、干瘪的小爪子随意地放在餐边柜上，显然不信它的优点。

"I suppose all old soldiers are the same," said Mrs. White. "The idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?"
"我想所有老兵都一样，"怀特夫人说。"我们竟然要听这种胡说八道！如今，愿望如何实现呢？如果能，两百磅又怎么会伤害你，父亲？"

"Might drop on his head from the sky," said the frivolous Herbert.
"可能会从天上掉下来砸到他头上，"轻浮的赫伯特说。

"Morris said the things happened so naturally," said his father, "that you might, if you so wished, attribute it to coincidence."
"莫里斯说事情发生得如此自然，"他的父亲说，"如果你愿意，可以把它归因于巧合。"

"Well, don't break into the money before I come back," said Herbert as he rose from the table. "I'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you."
"好吧，在我回来之前别动钱，"赫伯特站起身说道。"恐怕这会让你变成一个刻薄、贪婪的人，我们不得不断绝你的关系。"

His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband's credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired Sergeant-Majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor's bill.
母亲笑了，跟着他走到门口，目送他走在路上;回到早餐桌后，她非常高兴，尽管丈夫的轻信让她感到无比。但这些都没能阻止她在邮递员敲门时匆匆跑向门口，也没能阻止她在邮件收到裁缝账单时，短暂地提到了那些嗜酒的退休军士长。

"Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home," she said as they sat at dinner.
"我想赫伯特回家后会有更多他那幽默的话，"她在晚餐时说。

"I dare say," said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; "but for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I'll swear to."
"我敢说，"怀特先生倒啤酒说;"但尽管如此，那东西在我手中移动;我发誓会做到。"

"You thought it did," said the old lady soothingly.
"你以为会，"老太太温柔地说。

"I say it did," replied the other. "There was no thought about it; I had just—What's the matter?"
"我说确实如此，"另一个回答。"根本没想过;我只是——怎么了？"

His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connexion with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs. White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.
他的妻子没有回应。她注视着外面一个男人神秘的动作，那男人犹豫不决地凝视着房子，似乎在犹豫是否要进去。在这两百磅的心灵联系下，她注意到那陌生人穿着得体，戴着一顶崭新的丝绸帽。他在门口停了三次，然后又继续前行。第四次他站着，手放在门上，然后突然坚定地打开门，沿着小路走去。怀特夫人同时把手放在身后，急忙解开围裙的绳子，把那件实用的衣服放在椅子的垫子下。

She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologised for the appearance of the room, and her husband's coat—a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.
她把那个看起来不太自在的陌生人带进了房间。他偷偷地看着她，心不在焉地听着老太太为房间的布置和她丈夫的外套道歉——那件他通常只穿在花园里的衣服。她尽量耐心等待他开口，但他起初异常沉默。

"I—was asked to call," he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. "I come from Maw and Meggins."
"我——有人让他打电话，"他终于说，弯腰从裤子里掏出一块棉花。"我来自莫和梅金斯。"

The old lady started. "Is anything the matter?" she asked breathlessly. "Has anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?"
老太太开口了。"有什么事吗？"她气喘吁吁地问。"赫伯特出事了吗？这是什么？怎么了？"

Her husband interposed. "There, there, mother," he said hastily. "Sit down, and don't jump to conclusions. You've not brought bad news, I'm sure, sir," and he eyed the other wistfully.
她的丈夫插话道。"没事，没事，妈妈。"他急忙说道。"坐下，别急着下结论。我相信您没有带来坏消息，先生，"他带着一丝惆怅看着对方。

"I'm sorry—" began the visitor.
"对不起——"访客开口。

"Is he hurt?" demanded the mother wildly.
"他受伤了吗？"母亲疯狂地问。

The visitor bowed in assent. "Badly hurt," he said quietly, "but he is not in any pain."
访客鞠躬表示同意。"伤得很重，"他轻声说，"但他并不疼。"

"Oh, thank God!" said the old woman, clasping her hands. "Thank God for that! Thank—"
"哦，谢天谢地！"老妇人说着，双手合十。"谢天谢地！谢——"

She broke off as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned on her, and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the other's averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling hand on his. There was a long silence.
她话到一半停住，意识到这话的阴险含义，看到对方回避的脸上可怕地印证了她的恐惧。她喘了口气，转向迟钝的丈夫，颤抖的手放在他的手上。沉默了很久。

"He was caught in the machinery," said the visitor at length in a low voice.
"他被机械卡住了，"访客低声说道。

"Caught in the machinery," repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion—"yes."
"被机器困住了，"怀特先生迷迷糊糊地重复道——"是的。"

He sat staring out of the window, and taking his wife's hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting days nearly forty years before.
他坐着望着窗外，握住妻子的手，像近四十年前他们恋爱时那样轻轻握住。

"He was the only one left to us," he said, turning gently to the visitor. "It is hard."
"他是我们唯一剩下的，"他说，温柔地转向访客。"确实很难。"

The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. "The firm wishes me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss," he said, without looking round. "I beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders."
另一个人咳嗽了一声，站起身，慢慢走向窗户。"公司希望我转达他们对您重大损失的真挚慰问，"他说，没有回头。"我恳请您理解，我只是他们的仆人，只是服从命令。"

There was no reply; the old woman's face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband's face was a look such as his friend the Sergeant might have carried into his first action.
没有回应;老妇人的脸色惨白，眼睛凝视着，呼吸几乎听不见;丈夫脸上带着一种中士可能带着的表情。

"I was to say that Maw and Meggins disclaim all responsibility," continued the other. "They admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son's services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation."
"我本该说，莫和梅金斯不承担任何责任，"另一人继续说。"他们不承认任何责任，但鉴于你儿子的贡献，他们想给你一笔赔偿金。"

Mr. White dropped his wife's hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, "How much?"
怀特先生松开妻子的手，站起身，惊恐地看着来访者。他干涩的嘴唇挤出了"多少钱？"的字句。

"Two hundred pounds," was the answer.
"两百英镑，"答案是。

Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.
老者对妻子的尖叫毫无意识，微微一笑，像个盲人一样伸出双手，毫无意识地倒在地上。

Part III第三部分

In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to the house steeped in shadows and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realise it, and remained in a state of expectation—as though of something else to happen—something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.
在距离约两英里的新大型墓地里，老人们埋葬了死者，回到房子时笼罩在阴影和寂静中。一切发生得太快，起初他们几乎没意识到，仍处于期待状态——仿佛期待着别的事情会发生——某种能减轻这份沉重负担，年迈的心灵难以承受。

But the days passed, and expectation gave way to resignation—the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes miscalled apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.
但日子一天天过去，期待让位于无奈——那种旧有、有时被误称为冷漠的绝望无望。有时他们几乎一句话不说，因为现在无话可说，日子漫长而疲惫。

It was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.
大约一周后，老人在夜里突然醒来，伸出手，发现自己独自一人。房间一片黑暗，窗外传来压抑的哭泣声。他从床上坐起，倾听着。

"Come back," he said tenderly. "You will be cold."
"回来，"他温柔地说。"你会冷的。"

"It is colder for my son," said the old woman, and wept afresh.
"对我儿子来说更冷，"老妇人说，又哭了起来。

The sounds of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.
她的哭声在他耳边渐渐消失。床很温暖，他的眼睛还带着睡意。他断断续续地打盹，然后睡着了，直到妻子突然一声狂叫把他惊醒。

"THE PAW!" she cried wildly. "THE MONKEY'S PAW!"
"爪子！"她疯狂地喊道。"猴爪！"

He started up in alarm. "Where? Where is it? What's the matter?"
他惊慌地跳了起来。"在哪里？在哪里？怎么了？"

She came stumbling across the room toward him. "I want it," she said quietly. "You've not destroyed it?"
她踉跄着走过房间，朝他走来。"我想要，"她轻声说。"你没毁掉它？"

"It's in the parlour, on the bracket," he replied, marvelling. "Why?"
"就在客厅里，托架上，"他惊叹地回答。"为什么？"

She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.
她哭着笑着，弯腰亲了亲他的脸颊。

"I only just thought of it," she said hysterically. "Why didn't I think of it before? Why didn't you think of it?"
"我刚想到，"她歇斯底里地说。"我怎么之前没想到？你怎么没想到？"

"Think of what?" he questioned.
"想什么？"他问。

"The other two wishes," she replied rapidly. "We've only had one."
"另外两个愿望，"她迅速回答。"我们只吃过一次。"

"Was not that enough?" he demanded fiercely.
"这还不够吗？"他激烈地质问。

"No," she cried triumphantly; "we'll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again."
"不，"她得意地喊道;"我们还要再来一杯。快下去拿，祝我们的孩子活着。"

The man sat in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs. "Good God, you are mad!" he cried aghast. "Get it," she panted; "get it quickly, and wish—oh, my boy, my boy!"
那人坐在床上，抖抖的四肢上脱下被褥。"天哪，你疯了！"他惊叫道。"拿到了，"她喘息着说;"快点拿来，祝愿——哦，我的孩子，我的孩子！"

Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. "Get back to bed," he said unsteadily. "You don't know what you are saying."
她的丈夫点燃了蜡烛。"回床上去，"他颤抖着说。"你不知道你在说什么。"

"We had the first wish granted," said the old woman, feverishly; "why not the second?"
"我们得到了第一个愿望的实现，"老妇人焦急地说;"为什么不是第二个？"

"A coincidence," stammered the old man.
"巧合，"老人结结巴巴地说。

"Go, get it, and wish," cried his wife, quivering with excitement.
"去吧，去拿，许个愿吧，"妻子兴奋地颤抖着喊道。

The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. "He has been dead ten days, and besides he—I would not tell you else, but—I could only recognise him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?"
老人转身看着她，声音颤抖。"他已经死了十天，而且他——我不会告诉你别的，但我只能通过他的衣着认出他。如果他当时太可怕了，你看不到，现在怎么办？"

"Bring him back," cried the old woman, and dragged him towards the door. "Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?"
"把他带回来，"老妇人喊道，拉着他朝门口走去。"你以为我害怕我哺育的孩子吗？"

He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantelpiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized upon him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.
他在黑暗中下去，摸索着走到客厅，然后来到壁炉架。护符已就位，他心中涌起一种可怕的恐惧——那无言的愿望会在他逃出房间前将他残缺的儿子带到面前，他喘了口气，发现自己迷失了门的方向。额头因汗水而冰冷，他摸索着绕过桌子，沿着墙摸索，直到发现自己手里拿着那个不健康的东西，来到那条狭窄的通道。

Even his wife's face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.
甚至他妻子的脸在他进屋时似乎也变了。那是白色的，充满期待，令他担忧的是，看起来看起来不自然。他害怕她。

"WISH!" she cried in a strong voice.
"愿望！"她用坚定的声音喊道。

"It is foolish and wicked," he faltered.
"那是愚蠢且邪恶的，"他结巴了。

"WISH!" repeated his wife.
"愿望！"妻子重复道。

He raised his hand. "I wish my son alive again."
他举起了手。"我希望我的儿子能活着。"

The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank, trembling, into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.
符箓掉落在地，他惊恐地看着它。然后他颤抖着坐进椅子，老妇人眼神炽热，走向窗户，拉起百叶窗。

He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back to his bed, and a minute afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.
他坐到被寒意刺骨，偶尔瞥见那位老妇人透过窗户凝视的身影。烛台边缘下方的烛台末端燃烧着，在天花板和墙壁上投射出脉动的影子，直到一闪光比其他部分更大，熄灭了。老人因符咒失败而感到难以言喻的宽慰，悄悄回到床边，片刻后老妇人默默无言地走到他身旁。

Neither spoke, but sat silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.
两人都没说话，只是静静地听着时钟的滴答声。楼梯吱呀作响，一只吱吱作响的老鼠在墙里乱窜。黑暗压抑，他躺了一会儿鼓起勇气，拿起火柴盒，点燃一根，下楼去点蜡烛。

At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.
楼梯底下火柴熄灭，他停下来又击打一根;就在这时，前门传来一阵轻微而隐秘的敲门声。

The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended, until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.
火柴从他手中掉落，洒在通道里。他一动不动地站着，呼吸暂停，直到敲门声再次响起。然后他迅速转身逃回房间，关上了门。第三次敲门声在屋内响起。

"WHAT'S THAT?" cried the old woman, starting up.
"那是什么？"老妇人惊叫着，开始动弹。

"A rat," said the old man in shaking tones—"a rat. It passed me on the stairs."
"一只老鼠，"老人颤抖着说——"一只老鼠。它在楼梯上从我身边经过。"

His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.
他的妻子坐在床上听着。一声巨响在屋内响起。

"It's Herbert!""是赫伯特！"

She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.
她跑向门口，但丈夫已经站在她面前，抓住她的胳膊，紧紧抱住她。

"What are you going to do?" he whispered hoarsely.
"你打算做什么？"他嘶哑地低语。

"It's my boy; it's Herbert!" she cried, struggling mechanically. "I forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door."
"是我的孩子;是赫伯特！"她机械地挣扎着喊道。"我忘了它离这里有两英里远。你为什么扣留我？放手。我必须开门。"

"For God's sake don't let it in," cried the old man, trembling.
"看在上帝的份上，别让它进来，"老人颤抖着喊道。

"You're afraid of your own son," she cried, struggling. "Let me go. I'm coming, Herbert; I'm coming."
"你害怕自己的儿子，"她哭着挣扎。"放开我。我来了，赫伯特;我来了。"

There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman's voice, strained and panting—
又是敲门声，又敲了一声。老妇人突然抓住扳手挣脱，跑出了房间。丈夫跟着她走到楼梯间，急忙下楼时，她带着诱惑的口吻喊道。他听到链条咔哒作响，螺栓缓慢而坚定地从套筒中拔出。然后老妇人的声音，紧绷而喘息——

"The bolt," she cried loudly. "Come down. I can't reach it."
"螺栓，"她大声喊道。"下来吧。我够不到。"

But her husband was on his hands and knees, groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If only he could find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey's paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.
但她的丈夫跪在地上，疯狂地摸索着寻找那只爪子。要是能在外面那个东西进来之前找到它就好了。一阵完美的敲门声在屋内回荡，他听到妻子把椅子放在门边的走廊里，发出刮擦声。他听到螺栓缓缓回来的吱吱声，同时找到了猴子的爪子，疯狂地吐出第三个也是最后一个愿望。

The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long, loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him the courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp, flickering opposite, shone on a quiet and deserted road.
敲门声突然停止，尽管回声仍在屋内回荡。他听到椅子被拉开，门开了。一阵冷风呼啸而上楼梯，妻子发出一声长长而响亮的失望与痛苦哀号，给了他勇气跑到她身边，然后跑向门外的城门。对面闪烁的路灯照亮了一条安静而空无一人的道路。
