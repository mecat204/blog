Part I第一部分

Without, the night was cold and wet, but in the small parlour of Laburnum Villa the blinds were drawn and the fire burned brightly. Father and son were at chess; the former, who possessed ideas about the game involving radical chances, putting his king into such sharp and unnecessary perils that it even provoked comment from the white-haired old lady knitting placidly by the fire.
外面夜晚寒冷潮湿，但在拉伯南别墅的小客厅里，百叶窗拉上，火焰熊熊燃烧。父子俩都下棋;前者对游戏充满激进机会的看法，把国王置于极端且不必要的危险中，甚至引得那位白发老太太在火炉旁安静地编织，发出了评论。

"Hark at the wind," said Mr. White, who, having seen a fatal mistake after it was too late, was amiably desirous of preventing his son from seeing it.
"注意风向，"怀特先生说，他在为时已晚后看到致命错误，友好地希望阻止儿子看到。

"I'm listening," said the latter, grimly surveying the board as he stretched out his hand. "Check."
"我在听，"后者说，阴沉地打量着棋盘，伸出手。"检查。"

"I should hardly think he'll come to-night," said his father, with his hand poised over the board.
"我几乎不认为他今晚会来，"父亲说，手悬在黑板上。

"Mate," replied the son.
"伙计，"儿子回答。

"That's the worst of living so far out," bawled Mr. White, with sudden and unlooked-for violence. "Of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way places to live in, this is the worst. Path's a bog, and the road's a torrent. I don't know what people are thinking about. I suppose because only two houses in the road are let, they think it doesn't matter."
"活得这么远最糟糕，"怀特先生突然且意想不到地怒吼。"在所有肮脏、泥泞、偏僻的地方里，这里是最糟糕的。小路是泥沼，路是激流。我不知道大家在想什么。我想是因为路上只有两栋房子出租，他们觉得没什么大不了的。"

"Never mind, dear," said his wife soothingly; "perhaps you'll win the next one."
"没关系，亲爱的，"妻子温柔地说;"也许你会赢下一场。"

Mr. White looked up sharply, just in time to intercept a knowing glance between mother and son. The words died away on his lips, and he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey beard.
怀特先生猛地抬头，正好在母子间捕捉到一记心照不宣的眼神。话语在他嘴边消失，他把一抹愧疚的笑藏在细长的灰胡子里。

"There he is," said Herbert White, as the gate banged too loudly and heavy footsteps came toward the door.
"他来了，"赫伯特·怀特说，门砰地一声撞上，沉重的脚步声朝门口走来。

The old man rose with hospitable haste, and opening the door, was heard condoling with the new arrival. The new arrival also condoled with himself, so that Mrs. White said, "Tut, tut!" and coughed gently as her husband entered the room followed by a tall, burly man, beady of eye and rubicund of visage.
老人热情地起身，打开门时，听到有人在向新来者致意。新来者也自怜自慰，怀特夫人说了句"啧啧！"并轻咳一声，丈夫随后跟着一个高大魁梧、眼珠闪亮、脸色红润的男子走进房间。

"Sergeant-Major Morris," he said, introducing him.
"莫里斯军士长，"他介绍道。

The Sergeant-Major took hands, and taking the proffered seat by the fire, watched contentedly as his host got out whisky and tumblers and stood a small copper kettle on the fire.
军士长握住手，坐在火炉旁的座位上，满足地看着主人拿出威士忌和杯子，把一个小铜壶放在火上。

At the third glass his eyes got brighter, and he began to talk, the little family circle regarding with eager interest this visitor from distant parts, as he squared his broad shoulders in the chair and spoke of wild scenes and doughty deeds—of wars and plagues and strange peoples.
喝到第三杯时，他的眼睛变得明亮起来，开始说话，小家庭圈子里远方的访客满怀兴趣地看着他，他挺直宽阔的肩膀坐在椅子上，讲述着狂野的场景和英勇的事迹——战争、瘟疫和奇异的民族。

"Twenty-one years of it," said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. "When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him."
"二十一年了，"怀特先生点头示意妻子和儿子。"他离开时，在仓库里还是个瘦弱的年轻人。现在看看他。"

"He doesn't look to have taken much harm," said Mrs. White politely.
"他看起来没受什么大伤，"怀特夫人礼貌地说。

"I'd like to go to India myself," said the old man, "just to look around a bit, you know."
"我自己也想去印度，"老人说，"只是想四处看看，你知道的。"

"Better where you are," said the Sergeant-Major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass and sighing softly, shook it again.
"你在这儿更好，"军士长摇头说。他放下空杯，轻轻叹气，又摇了摇杯子。

"I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers," said the old man. "What was that you started telling me the other day about a monkey's paw or something, Morris?"
"我倒想看看那些老庙宇、苦行僧和杂耍者，"老人说。"莫里斯，你前几天开始跟我说猴爪什么的？"

"Nothing," said the soldier hastily. "Leastways, nothing worth hearing."
"没什么，"士兵急忙说。"至少，没什么值得听的。"

"Monkey's paw?" said Mrs. White curiously.
"猴爪？"怀特夫人好奇地问。

"Well, it's just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps," said the Sergeant-Major off-handedly.
"嗯，这大概就是你们所谓的魔法吧，"军士长漫不经心地说。

His three listeners leaned forward eagerly. The visitor absent-mindedly put his empty glass to his lips and then set it down again. His host filled it for him once more.
他的三位听众兴奋地向前倾身。访客心不在焉地把空杯子放到嘴边，又放下了。他的主人又为他倒满了酒。

"To look at," said the Sergeant-Major, fumbling in his pocket, "it's just an ordinary little paw, dried to a mummy."
"看着，"军士长一边在口袋里摸索一边说，"这只是一只普通的小爪子，干成木乃伊了。"

He took something out of his pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White drew back with a grimace, but her son, taking it, examined it curiously.
他从口袋里掏出一样东西递了过去。怀特夫人皱着眉退了回去，但她的儿子接过手，好奇地打量着。

"And what is there special about it?" inquired Mr. White, as he took it from his son and, having examined it, placed it upon the table.
"那它有什么特别的？"怀特先生一边从儿子手中接过信纸，一边检查后放在桌上，问道。

"It had a spell put on it by an old fakir," said the Sergeant-Major, "a very holy man. He wanted to show that fate ruled people's lives, and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow. He put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it."
"那是个老苦行僧对它施了魔法，"军士长说，"一个非常圣洁的人。他想表明命运主宰着人们的生活，而那些干涉命运的人，都是让他们感到悲伤。他对它施了魔法，让三个不同的人各自可以从中得到三个愿望。"

His manner was so impressive that his hearers were conscious that their light laughter had jarred somewhat.
他的举止令人印象深刻，听众都意识到了，轻笑声有些震惊。

"Well, why don't you have three, sir?" said Herbert White cleverly.
"那您为什么不喝三杯呢，先生？"赫伯特·怀特机智地说。

The soldier regarded him the way that middle age is wont to regard presumptuous youth. "I have," he said quietly, and his blotchy face whitened.
士兵看他的方式，就像中年人对自负的年轻人的态度。"我见过，"他轻声说，斑驳的脸色变得白皙。

"And did you really have the three wishes granted?" asked Mrs. White.
"你真的实现了三个愿望吗？"怀特夫人问。

"I did," said the Sergeant-Major, and his glass tapped against his strong teeth.
"我确实说过，"军士长说，酒杯敲击着他坚硬的牙齿。

"And has anybody else wished?" persisted the old lady.
"还有别人想过吗？"老太太坚持问。

"The first man had his three wishes, yes," was the reply; "I don't know what the first two were, but the third was for death. That's how I got the paw."
"第一个人有三个愿望，是的，"回答;"我不知道前两个是什么，但第三个是关于死亡的。我就是靠这个得到那只爪子的。"

His tones were so grave that a hush fell upon the group.
他的语气严肃，令众人顿时安静下来。

"If you've had your three wishes, it's no good to you now then, Morris," said the old man at last. "What do you keep it for?"
"如果你已经实现了三个愿望，那现在对你没用了，莫里斯，"老人终于说道。"你为什么留着？"

The soldier shook his head. "Fancy, I suppose," he said slowly. "I did have some idea of selling it, but I don't think I will. It has caused me enough mischief already. Besides, people won't buy. They think it's a fairy tale, some of them; and those who do think anything of it want to try it first and pay me afterwards."
士兵摇了摇头。"算是高级吧，"他慢慢说。"我确实有卖掉它的想法，但我想我不会了。这已经给我带来了够多的麻烦了。而且，人们不会买单。他们觉得这是童话故事，有些人;那些觉得有点问题的人，想先试试，然后再付钱给我。"

"If you could have another three wishes," said the old man, eyeing him keenly, "would you have them?"
"如果你能再许三个愿望，"老人锐利地看着他说，"你会想要吗？"

"I don't know," said the other. "I don't know."
"我不知道，"另一个人说。"我不知道。"

He took the paw, and dangling it between his forefinger and thumb, suddenly threw it upon the fire. White, with a slight cry, stooped down and snatched it off.
他拿起爪子，用食指和拇指夹着，突然把它扔进火堆里。怀特轻声叫了一声，弯腰抢过了它。

"Better let it burn," said the soldier solemnly.
"还是让它烧掉吧。"士兵郑重地说道。

"If you don't want it, Morris," said the other, "give it to me."
"如果你不想要，莫里斯，"另一个说，"给我吧。"

"I won't," said his friend doggedly. "I threw it on the fire. If you keep it, don't blame me for what happens. Pitch it on the fire like a sensible man."
"我不会的，"他的朋友坚定地说。"我把它扔进了火里。如果你留下了，别怪我发生了什么。像个理智的人一样把它扔进火里。"

The other shook his head and examined his possession closely. "How do you do it?" he inquired.
对方摇头，仔细检查自己的物品。"你是怎么做到的？"他问。

"Hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud," said the Sergeant-Major; "but I warn you of the consequences."
"把它举在右手里，大声许愿，"军士长说;"但我警告你后果。"

"Sounds like the Arabian Nights," said Mrs. White, as she rose and began to set the supper. "Don't you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me?"
"听起来像《一千零一夜》，"怀特夫人站起身开始摆晚餐时说道。"你难道不觉得你会希望我有四双手吗？"

Her husband drew the talisman from his pocket, and all three burst into laughter as the Sergeant-Major, with a look of alarm on his face, caught him by the arm.
她的丈夫从口袋里掏出护身符，三人都笑了起来，军士长脸上带着惊恐的表情抓住了他的手臂。

"If you must wish," he said gruffly, "wish for something sensible."
"如果你非得许愿，"他粗声说，"许个合理的愿。"

Mr. White dropped it back in his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned his friend to the table. In the business of supper the talisman was partly forgotten, and afterward the three sat listening in an enthralled fashion to a second instalment of the soldier's adventures in India.
怀特先生把它放回口袋，摆好椅子，示意朋友坐到桌边。晚餐时，护身符部分被遗忘，之后三人专注地聆听士兵在印度的第二部分冒险故事。

"If the tale about the monkey's paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us," said Herbert, as the door closed behind their guest, just in time to catch the last train, "we shan't make much out of it."
"如果关于猴子爪子的故事不比他告诉我们的更真实，"赫伯特说，门在客人身后关上，正好赶上末班火车，"我们也没什么大好想。"

"Did you give anything for it, father?" inquired Mrs. White, regarding her husband closely.
"父亲，你有为它付出什么吗？"怀特夫人仔细打量着丈夫问道。

"A trifle," said he, colouring slightly. "He didn't want it, but I made him take it. And he pressed me again to throw it away."
"小事，"他说，脸色微微泛红。"他本不想，但我让他吃了。他又催我把它扔掉。"

"Likely," said Herbert, with pretended horror. "Why, we're going to be rich, and famous, and happy. Wish to be an emperor, father, to begin with; then you can't be henpecked."
"很可能，"赫伯特假装惊恐地说。"为什么，我们会变得富有、出名、幸福。父亲，一开始就想成为皇帝;那你就不能被管着了。"

He darted round the table, pursued by the maligned Mrs. White armed with an antimacassar.
他绕过桌子，被那个备受诅咒的怀特夫人紧追不舍，手持一把反马卡萨尔。

Mr. White took the paw from his pocket and eyed it dubiously. "I don't know what to wish for, and that's a fact," he said slowly. "It seems to me I've got all I want."
怀特先生从口袋里拿出爪子，怀疑地看着它。"我不知道该许什么愿，这是事实，"他慢慢说。"在我看来，我已经得到了我想要的一切。"

"If you only cleared the house you'd be quite happy, wouldn't you!" said Herbert, with his hand on his shoulder. "Well, wish for two hundred pounds, then; that'll just do it."
"如果你能把房子清理干净，你会很开心的，不是吗！"赫伯特一边说，一边把手搭在他的肩膀上。"那就许愿两百英镑吧;这就够了。"

His father, smiling shamefacedly at his own credulity, held up the talisman, as his son, with a solemn face somewhat marred by a wink at his mother, sat down and struck a few impressive chords.
父亲羞愧地笑着，举起符箓，儿子面色庄重，脸上带着对母亲的眨眼，坐下敲响了几句令人印象深刻的和弦。

"I wish for two hundred pounds," said the old man distinctly.
"我希望有两百英镑，"老人清晰地说。

A fine crash from the piano greeted his words, interrupted by a shuddering cry from the old man. His wife and son ran toward him.
钢琴发出清脆的撞击声，随即被老人颤抖的呼喊打断。他的妻子和儿子朝他跑来。

"It moved," he cried, with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor. "As I wished, it twisted in my hand like a snake."
"它动了，"他哭喊着，带着厌恶的目光看着躺在地上的物体。"正如我所愿，它在我手中像蛇一样扭动。"

"Well, I don't see the money," said his son, as he picked it up and placed it on the table, "and I bet I never shall."
"嗯，我没看到钱，"儿子一边捡起钱放在桌上一边说，"我敢打赌我永远也看不到。"

"It must have been your fancy, father," said his wife, regarding him anxiously.
"父亲，这一定是您的心血，"妻子焦急地看着他说。

He shook his head. "Never mind, though; there's no harm done, but it gave me a shock all the same."
他摇了摇头。"不过算了;没造成什么伤害，但还是让我很震惊。"

They sat down by the fire again while the two men finished their pipes. Outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man started nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs. A silence, unusual and depressing, settled on all three, which lasted until the old couple rose to retire for the rest of the night.
他们又坐在火炉旁，两人完成了烟斗的制作。外面风比以往任何时候都大，老人听到楼上传来敲门声，紧张地吓了一跳。一种罕见而令人沮丧的沉默笼罩着三人，直到老夫妇起身准备休息，直到他们继续休息。

"I expect you'll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed," said Herbert, as he bade them good night, "and something horrible squatting on top of your wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill-gotten gains."
"我猜你们会发现现金被绑在床中央的大袋子里，"赫伯特说着道晚安，"还有什么可怕的东西蹲在你们衣柜顶上，看着你们揣着那些不义之财。"

He sat alone in the darkness, gazing at the dying fire and seeing faces in it. The last was so horrible and so simian that he gazed at it in amazement. It got so vivid that, with a little uneasy laugh, he felt on the table for a glass containing a little water to throw over it. His hand grasped the monkey's paw, and with a little shiver he wiped his hand on his coat and went up to bed.
他独自坐在黑暗中，凝视着渐渐熄灭的火焰，看到里面的面孔。最后一个太可怕、太像猿猴了，他惊讶地盯着它看。画面变得如此鲜明，他带着一丝不安的笑声，摸索着桌上找一个装有点水的杯子泼上去。他握住猴子的爪子，带着一阵颤抖，用外套擦了擦手，然后上床睡觉。

Part II第二部分

In the brightness of the wintry sun next morning, as it streamed over the breakfast table, he laughed at his fears. There was an air of prosaic wholesomeness about the room which it had lacked on the previous night, and the dirty, shrivelled little paw was pitched on the sideboard with a carelessness which betokened no great belief in its virtues.
第二天清晨，冬日阳光洒在早餐桌上，他笑着嘲笑自己的恐惧。房间里弥漫着一种平凡而健康的气息，这是前一晚所缺乏的，那只肮脏、干瘪的小爪子随意地放在餐边柜上，显然不信它的优点。

"I suppose all old soldiers are the same," said Mrs. White. "The idea of our listening to such nonsense! How could wishes be granted in these days? And if they could, how could two hundred pounds hurt you, father?"
"我想所有老兵都一样，"怀特夫人说。"我们竟然要听这种胡说八道！如今，愿望如何实现呢？如果能，两百磅又怎么会伤害你，父亲？"

"Might drop on his head from the sky," said the frivolous Herbert.
"可能会从天上掉下来砸到他头上，"轻浮的赫伯特说。

"Morris said the things happened so naturally," said his father, "that you might, if you so wished, attribute it to coincidence."
"莫里斯说事情发生得如此自然，"他的父亲说，"如果你愿意，可以把它归因于巧合。"

"Well, don't break into the money before I come back," said Herbert as he rose from the table. "I'm afraid it'll turn you into a mean, avaricious man, and we shall have to disown you."
"好吧，在我回来之前别动钱，"赫伯特站起身说道。"恐怕这会让你变成一个刻薄、贪婪的人，我们不得不断绝你的关系。"

His mother laughed, and following him to the door, watched him down the road; and returning to the breakfast table, was very happy at the expense of her husband's credulity. All of which did not prevent her from scurrying to the door at the postman's knock, nor prevent her from referring somewhat shortly to retired Sergeant-Majors of bibulous habits when she found that the post brought a tailor's bill.
母亲笑了，跟着他走到门口，目送他走在路上;回到早餐桌后，她非常高兴，尽管丈夫的轻信让她感到无比。但这些都没能阻止她在邮递员敲门时匆匆跑向门口，也没能阻止她在邮件收到裁缝账单时，短暂地提到了那些嗜酒的退休军士长。

"Herbert will have some more of his funny remarks, I expect, when he comes home," she said as they sat at dinner.
"我想赫伯特回家后会有更多他那幽默的话，"她在晚餐时说。

"I dare say," said Mr. White, pouring himself out some beer; "but for all that, the thing moved in my hand; that I'll swear to."
"我敢说，"怀特先生倒啤酒说;"但尽管如此，那东西在我手中移动;我发誓会做到。"

"You thought it did," said the old lady soothingly.
"你以为会，"老太太温柔地说。

"I say it did," replied the other. "There was no thought about it; I had just—What's the matter?"
"我说确实如此，"另一个回答。"根本没想过;我只是——怎么了？"

His wife made no reply. She was watching the mysterious movements of a man outside, who, peering in an undecided fashion at the house, appeared to be trying to make up his mind to enter. In mental connexion with the two hundred pounds, she noticed that the stranger was well dressed, and wore a silk hat of glossy newness. Three times he paused at the gate, and then walked on again. The fourth time he stood with his hand upon it, and then with sudden resolution flung it open and walked up the path. Mrs. White at the same moment placed her hands behind her, and hurriedly unfastening the strings of her apron, put that useful article of apparel beneath the cushion of her chair.
他的妻子没有回应。她注视着外面一个男人神秘的动作，那男人犹豫不决地凝视着房子，似乎在犹豫是否要进去。在这两百磅的心灵联系下，她注意到那陌生人穿着得体，戴着一顶崭新的丝绸帽。他在门口停了三次，然后又继续前行。第四次他站着，手放在门上，然后突然坚定地打开门，沿着小路走去。怀特夫人同时把手放在身后，急忙解开围裙的绳子，把那件实用的衣服放在椅子的垫子下。

She brought the stranger, who seemed ill at ease, into the room. He gazed at her furtively, and listened in a preoccupied fashion as the old lady apologised for the appearance of the room, and her husband's coat—a garment which he usually reserved for the garden. She then waited as patiently as her sex would permit for him to broach his business, but he was at first strangely silent.
她把那个看起来不太自在的陌生人带进了房间。他偷偷地看着她，心不在焉地听着老太太为房间的布置和她丈夫的外套道歉——那件他通常只穿在花园里的衣服。她尽量耐心等待他开口，但他起初异常沉默。

"I—was asked to call," he said at last, and stooped and picked a piece of cotton from his trousers. "I come from Maw and Meggins."
"我——有人让他打电话，"他终于说，弯腰从裤子里掏出一块棉花。"我来自莫和梅金斯。"

The old lady started. "Is anything the matter?" she asked breathlessly. "Has anything happened to Herbert? What is it? What is it?"
老太太开口了。"有什么事吗？"她气喘吁吁地问。"赫伯特出事了吗？这是什么？怎么了？"

Her husband interposed. "There, there, mother," he said hastily. "Sit down, and don't jump to conclusions. You've not brought bad news, I'm sure, sir," and he eyed the other wistfully.
她的丈夫插话道。"没事，没事，妈妈。"他急忙说道。"坐下，别急着下结论。我相信您没有带来坏消息，先生，"他带着一丝惆怅看着对方。

"I'm sorry—" began the visitor.
"对不起——"访客开口。

"Is he hurt?" demanded the mother wildly.
"他受伤了吗？"母亲疯狂地问。

The visitor bowed in assent. "Badly hurt," he said quietly, "but he is not in any pain."
访客鞠躬表示同意。"伤得很重，"他轻声说，"但他并不疼。"

"Oh, thank God!" said the old woman, clasping her hands. "Thank God for that! Thank—"
"哦，谢天谢地！"老妇人说着，双手合十。"谢天谢地！谢——"

She broke off as the sinister meaning of the assurance dawned on her, and she saw the awful confirmation of her fears in the other's averted face. She caught her breath, and turning to her slower-witted husband, laid her trembling hand on his. There was a long silence.
她话到一半停住，意识到这话的阴险含义，看到对方回避的脸上可怕地印证了她的恐惧。她喘了口气，转向迟钝的丈夫，颤抖的手放在他的手上。沉默了很久。

"He was caught in the machinery," said the visitor at length in a low voice.
"他被机械卡住了，"访客低声说道。

"Caught in the machinery," repeated Mr. White, in a dazed fashion—"yes."
"被机器困住了，"怀特先生迷迷糊糊地重复道——"是的。"

He sat staring out of the window, and taking his wife's hand between his own, pressed it as he had been wont to do in their old courting days nearly forty years before.
他坐着望着窗外，握住妻子的手，像近四十年前他们恋爱时那样轻轻握住。

"He was the only one left to us," he said, turning gently to the visitor. "It is hard."
"他是我们唯一剩下的，"他说，温柔地转向访客。"确实很难。"

The other coughed, and rising, walked slowly to the window. "The firm wishes me to convey their sincere sympathy with you in your great loss," he said, without looking round. "I beg that you will understand I am only their servant and merely obeying orders."
另一个人咳嗽了一声，站起身，慢慢走向窗户。"公司希望我转达他们对您重大损失的真挚慰问，"他说，没有回头。"我恳请您理解，我只是他们的仆人，只是服从命令。"

There was no reply; the old woman's face was white, her eyes staring, and her breath inaudible; on the husband's face was a look such as his friend the Sergeant might have carried into his first action.
没有回应;老妇人的脸色惨白，眼睛凝视着，呼吸几乎听不见;丈夫脸上带着一种中士可能带着的表情。

"I was to say that Maw and Meggins disclaim all responsibility," continued the other. "They admit no liability at all, but in consideration of your son's services, they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation."
"我本该说，莫和梅金斯不承担任何责任，"另一人继续说。"他们不承认任何责任，但鉴于你儿子的贡献，他们想给你一笔赔偿金。"

Mr. White dropped his wife's hand, and rising to his feet, gazed with a look of horror at his visitor. His dry lips shaped the words, "How much?"
怀特先生松开妻子的手，站起身，惊恐地看着来访者。他干涩的嘴唇挤出了"多少钱？"的字句。

"Two hundred pounds," was the answer.
"两百英镑，"答案是。

Unconscious of his wife's shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put out his hands like a sightless man, and dropped, a senseless heap, to the floor.
老者对妻子的尖叫毫无意识，微微一笑，像个盲人一样伸出双手，毫无意识地倒在地上。

Part III第三部分

In the huge new cemetery, some two miles distant, the old people buried their dead, and came back to the house steeped in shadows and silence. It was all over so quickly that at first they could hardly realise it, and remained in a state of expectation—as though of something else to happen—something else which was to lighten this load, too heavy for old hearts to bear.
在距离约两英里的新大型墓地里，老人们埋葬了死者，回到房子时笼罩在阴影和寂静中。一切发生得太快，起初他们几乎没意识到，仍处于期待状态——仿佛期待着别的事情会发生——某种能减轻这份沉重负担，年迈的心灵难以承受。

But the days passed, and expectation gave way to resignation—the hopeless resignation of the old, sometimes miscalled apathy. Sometimes they hardly exchanged a word, for now they had nothing to talk about, and their days were long to weariness.
但日子一天天过去，期待让位于无奈——那种旧有、有时被误称为冷漠的绝望无望。有时他们几乎一句话不说，因为现在无话可说，日子漫长而疲惫。

It was about a week after that the old man, waking suddenly in the night, stretched out his hand and found himself alone. The room was in darkness, and the sound of subdued weeping came from the window. He raised himself in bed and listened.
大约一周后，老人在夜里突然醒来，伸出手，发现自己独自一人。房间一片黑暗，窗外传来压抑的哭泣声。他从床上坐起，倾听着。

"Come back," he said tenderly. "You will be cold."
"回来，"他温柔地说。"你会冷的。"

"It is colder for my son," said the old woman, and wept afresh.
"对我儿子来说更冷，"老妇人说，又哭了起来。

The sounds of her sobs died away on his ears. The bed was warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep. He dozed fitfully, and then slept until a sudden wild cry from his wife awoke him with a start.
她的哭声在他耳边渐渐消失。床很温暖，他的眼睛还带着睡意。他断断续续地打盹，然后睡着了，直到妻子突然一声狂叫把他惊醒。

"THE PAW!" she cried wildly. "THE MONKEY'S PAW!"
"爪子！"她疯狂地喊道。"猴爪！"

He started up in alarm. "Where? Where is it? What's the matter?"
他惊慌地跳了起来。"在哪里？在哪里？怎么了？"

She came stumbling across the room toward him. "I want it," she said quietly. "You've not destroyed it?"
她踉跄着走过房间，朝他走来。"我想要，"她轻声说。"你没毁掉它？"

"It's in the parlour, on the bracket," he replied, marvelling. "Why?"
"就在客厅里，托架上，"他惊叹地回答。"为什么？"

She cried and laughed together, and bending over, kissed his cheek.
她哭着笑着，弯腰亲了亲他的脸颊。

"I only just thought of it," she said hysterically. "Why didn't I think of it before? Why didn't you think of it?"
"我刚想到，"她歇斯底里地说。"我怎么之前没想到？你怎么没想到？"

"Think of what?" he questioned.
"想什么？"他问。

"The other two wishes," she replied rapidly. "We've only had one."
"另外两个愿望，"她迅速回答。"我们只吃过一次。"

"Was not that enough?" he demanded fiercely.
"这还不够吗？"他激烈地质问。

"No," she cried triumphantly; "we'll have one more. Go down and get it quickly, and wish our boy alive again."
"不，"她得意地喊道;"我们还要再来一杯。快下去拿，祝我们的孩子活着。"

The man sat in bed and flung the bedclothes from his quaking limbs. "Good God, you are mad!" he cried aghast. "Get it," she panted; "get it quickly, and wish—oh, my boy, my boy!"
那人坐在床上，抖抖的四肢上脱下被褥。"天哪，你疯了！"他惊叫道。"拿到了，"她喘息着说;"快点拿来，祝愿——哦，我的孩子，我的孩子！"

Her husband struck a match and lit the candle. "Get back to bed," he said unsteadily. "You don't know what you are saying."
她的丈夫点燃了蜡烛。"回床上去，"他颤抖着说。"你不知道你在说什么。"

"We had the first wish granted," said the old woman, feverishly; "why not the second?"
"我们得到了第一个愿望的实现，"老妇人焦急地说;"为什么不是第二个？"

"A coincidence," stammered the old man.
"巧合，"老人结结巴巴地说。

"Go, get it, and wish," cried his wife, quivering with excitement.
"去吧，去拿，许个愿吧，"妻子兴奋地颤抖着喊道。

The old man turned and regarded her, and his voice shook. "He has been dead ten days, and besides he—I would not tell you else, but—I could only recognise him by his clothing. If he was too terrible for you to see then, how now?"
老人转身看着她，声音颤抖。"他已经死了十天，而且他——我不会告诉你别的，但我只能通过他的衣着认出他。如果他当时太可怕了，你看不到，现在怎么办？"

"Bring him back," cried the old woman, and dragged him towards the door. "Do you think I fear the child I have nursed?"
"把他带回来，"老妇人喊道，拉着他朝门口走去。"你以为我害怕我哺育的孩子吗？"

He went down in the darkness, and felt his way to the parlour, and then to the mantelpiece. The talisman was in its place, and a horrible fear that the unspoken wish might bring his mutilated son before him ere he could escape from the room seized upon him, and he caught his breath as he found that he had lost the direction of the door. His brow cold with sweat, he felt his way round the table, and groped along the wall until he found himself in the small passage with the unwholesome thing in his hand.
他在黑暗中下去，摸索着走到客厅，然后来到壁炉架。护符已就位，他心中涌起一种可怕的恐惧——那无言的愿望会在他逃出房间前将他残缺的儿子带到面前，他喘了口气，发现自己迷失了门的方向。额头因汗水而冰冷，他摸索着绕过桌子，沿着墙摸索，直到发现自己手里拿着那个不健康的东西，来到那条狭窄的通道。

Even his wife's face seemed changed as he entered the room. It was white and expectant, and to his fears seemed to have an unnatural look upon it. He was afraid of her.
甚至他妻子的脸在他进屋时似乎也变了。那是白色的，充满期待，令他担忧的是，看起来看起来不自然。他害怕她。

"WISH!" she cried in a strong voice.
"愿望！"她用坚定的声音喊道。

"It is foolish and wicked," he faltered.
"那是愚蠢且邪恶的，"他结巴了。

"WISH!" repeated his wife.
"愿望！"妻子重复道。

He raised his hand. "I wish my son alive again."
他举起了手。"我希望我的儿子能活着。"

The talisman fell to the floor, and he regarded it fearfully. Then he sank, trembling, into a chair as the old woman, with burning eyes, walked to the window and raised the blind.
符箓掉落在地，他惊恐地看着它。然后他颤抖着坐进椅子，老妇人眼神炽热，走向窗户，拉起百叶窗。

He sat until he was chilled with the cold, glancing occasionally at the figure of the old woman peering through the window. The candle-end, which had burned below the rim of the china candlestick, was throwing pulsating shadows on the ceiling and walls, until with a flicker larger than the rest, it expired. The old man, with an unspeakable sense of relief at the failure of the talisman, crept back to his bed, and a minute afterward the old woman came silently and apathetically beside him.
他坐到被寒意刺骨，偶尔瞥见那位老妇人透过窗户凝视的身影。烛台边缘下方的烛台末端燃烧着，在天花板和墙壁上投射出脉动的影子，直到一闪光比其他部分更大，熄灭了。老人因符咒失败而感到难以言喻的宽慰，悄悄回到床边，片刻后老妇人默默无言地走到他身旁。

Neither spoke, but sat silently listening to the ticking of the clock. A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall. The darkness was oppressive, and after lying for some time screwing up his courage, he took the box of matches, and striking one, went downstairs for a candle.
两人都没说话，只是静静地听着时钟的滴答声。楼梯吱呀作响，一只吱吱作响的老鼠在墙里乱窜。黑暗压抑，他躺了一会儿鼓起勇气，拿起火柴盒，点燃一根，下楼去点蜡烛。

At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he paused to strike another; and at the same moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy as to be scarcely audible, sounded on the front door.
楼梯底下火柴熄灭，他停下来又击打一根;就在这时，前门传来一阵轻微而隐秘的敲门声。

The matches fell from his hand and spilled in the passage. He stood motionless, his breath suspended, until the knock was repeated. Then he turned and fled swiftly back to his room, and closed the door behind him. A third knock sounded through the house.
火柴从他手中掉落，洒在通道里。他一动不动地站着，呼吸暂停，直到敲门声再次响起。然后他迅速转身逃回房间，关上了门。第三次敲门声在屋内响起。

"WHAT'S THAT?" cried the old woman, starting up.
"那是什么？"老妇人惊叫着，开始动弹。

"A rat," said the old man in shaking tones—"a rat. It passed me on the stairs."
"一只老鼠，"老人颤抖着说——"一只老鼠。它在楼梯上从我身边经过。"

His wife sat up in bed listening. A loud knock resounded through the house.
他的妻子坐在床上听着。一声巨响在屋内响起。

"It's Herbert!""是赫伯特！"

She ran to the door, but her husband was before her, and catching her by the arm, held her tightly.
她跑向门口，但丈夫已经站在她面前，抓住她的胳膊，紧紧抱住她。

"What are you going to do?" he whispered hoarsely.
"你打算做什么？"他嘶哑地低语。

"It's my boy; it's Herbert!" she cried, struggling mechanically. "I forgot it was two miles away. What are you holding me for? Let go. I must open the door."
"是我的孩子;是赫伯特！"她机械地挣扎着喊道。"我忘了它离这里有两英里远。你为什么扣留我？放手。我必须开门。"

"For God's sake don't let it in," cried the old man, trembling.
"看在上帝的份上，别让它进来，"老人颤抖着喊道。

"You're afraid of your own son," she cried, struggling. "Let me go. I'm coming, Herbert; I'm coming."
"你害怕自己的儿子，"她哭着挣扎。"放开我。我来了，赫伯特;我来了。"

There was another knock, and another. The old woman with a sudden wrench broke free and ran from the room. Her husband followed to the landing, and called after her appealingly as she hurried downstairs. He heard the chain rattle back and the bolt drawn slowly and stiffly from the socket. Then the old woman's voice, strained and panting—
又是敲门声，又敲了一声。老妇人突然抓住扳手挣脱，跑出了房间。丈夫跟着她走到楼梯间，急忙下楼时，她带着诱惑的口吻喊道。他听到链条咔哒作响，螺栓缓慢而坚定地从套筒中拔出。然后老妇人的声音，紧绷而喘息——

"The bolt," she cried loudly. "Come down. I can't reach it."
"螺栓，"她大声喊道。"下来吧。我够不到。"

But her husband was on his hands and knees, groping wildly on the floor in search of the paw. If only he could find it before the thing outside got in. A perfect fusillade of knocks reverberated through the house, and he heard the scraping of a chair as his wife put it down in the passage against the door. He heard the creaking of the bolt as it came slowly back, and at the same moment he found the monkey's paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish.
但她的丈夫跪在地上，疯狂地摸索着寻找那只爪子。要是能在外面那个东西进来之前找到它就好了。一阵完美的敲门声在屋内回荡，他听到妻子把椅子放在门边的走廊里，发出刮擦声。他听到螺栓缓缓回来的吱吱声，同时找到了猴子的爪子，疯狂地吐出第三个也是最后一个愿望。

The knocking ceased suddenly, although the echoes of it were still in the house. He heard the chair drawn back, and the door opened. A cold wind rushed up the staircase, and a long, loud wail of disappointment and misery from his wife gave him the courage to run down to her side, and then to the gate beyond. The street lamp, flickering opposite, shone on a quiet and deserted road.
敲门声突然停止，尽管回声仍在屋内回荡。他听到椅子被拉开，门开了。一阵冷风呼啸而上楼梯，妻子发出一声长长而响亮的失望与痛苦哀号，给了他勇气跑到她身边，然后跑向门外的城门。对面闪烁的路灯照亮了一条安静而空无一人的道路。
