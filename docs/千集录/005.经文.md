* **法会因由分第一**
  - 如是我闻：

  - 一时佛在舍卫国祈树给孤独园，与大比丘众千二百五十人俱。尔时世尊，食时着衣持钵，入舍卫大城乞食。于其城中次第乞已，还至本处，饭食讫，收衣钵，洗足已，敷座而坐。

* **Chapter 01**
  - This is what I heard.
  - At one time the Buddha was staying in the Jeta Grove, near the city of Sravasti.
  - With him there was a community of 1,250 venerable monks and devoted disciples.
  - One day before dawn, the Buddha clothed himself, and along with his disciples took up his alms bowl and entered the city to beg for food door to door, as was his custom.
  - After he had returned and eaten, he put away his bowl and cloak, bathed his feet, and then sat with his legs crossed and body upright upon the seat arranged for him.
  - He began mindfully fixing his attention in front of himself, while many monks approached the Buddha, and showing great reverence, seated themselves around him.

* **法会因由分第一·译文**
  - 这是我亲耳听佛陀所说的。

  - 那个时候，佛陀居住在舍卫国的祇树给孤独园里，与他在一起的一共有一千二百五十位德行高深的大比丘僧人。

  - 有一天，到了该用斋饭的时候，佛陀穿上僧衣，拿着饭钵，和弟子们一同走进舍卫城中去乞食。在城里，他们挨家挨户地、不分贫富依次化缘。化到食物后，就返回祇树给孤独园。吃完饭后，佛陀收起僧衣和饭钵，洗干净双脚，然后铺好座位，盘腿端身正坐。

  - 这时，许多弟子都来到佛陀身边，恭敬地向佛陀行礼后，围坐在他的四周。

* **善现启请分第二**
  - 时长老须菩提，在大众中，即从座起，偏袒右肩，右膝着地，合掌恭敬而白佛言："希有，世尊，如来善护念诸菩萨，善付嘱诸菩萨。世尊，善男子、善女人发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提心，云何应住？云何降伏其心？"

  - 佛言："善哉，善哉，须菩提，如汝所说，如来善护念诸菩萨，善付嘱诸菩萨。汝今谛听，当为汝说。善男子、善女人，发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提心，应如是住，如是降伏其心。"

  - "唯然，世尊，愿乐欲闻。"

* **Chapter 02**
  - After a time a most venerable monk named Subhuti, who was sitting in the congregation, rose from his seat.
  - He uncovered his right shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, and as he joined his palms together he respectfully bowed and then addressed the Buddha:
  - "Most Honored One, It is truly majestic how much knowledge and wisdom your monks and disciples have been given through your most inspired teachings! It is remarkable that you look after our welfare so selflessly and so completely."
  - "Most Honored One, I have a question to ask you. If sons and daughters of good families want to develop the highest, most fulfilled and awakened mind, if they wish to attain the Highest Perfect Wisdom, what should they do to help quiet their drifting minds and help subdue their craving thoughts?"
  - The Buddha then replied:
  - "So it is as you say, Subhuti. Monks and disciples have been favored with the highest favor by the Buddha, the monks and disciples have been instructed with the highest instruction by the Buddha. The Buddha is constantly mindful of the welfare of his followers. Listen carefully with your full attention, and I will speak to your question."
  - "If sons and daughters of good families want to develop the highest, most fulfilled and awakened mind, if they wish to attain the Highest Perfect Wisdom and quiet their drifting minds while subduing their craving thoughts, then they should follow what I am about to say to you. Those who follow what I am about to say here will be able to subdue their discriminative thoughts and craving desires. It is possible to attain perfect tranquility and clarity of mind by absorbing and dwelling on the teachings I am about to give."
  - Then the Buddha addressed the assembly.

* **善现启请分第二·译文**
  - 这时，人群中一位名叫须菩提的长老，从座位上站起身来。他整理了一下衣衫，袒露右肩，右膝跪地，双手合十，恭恭敬敬向佛陀行礼问道：

  - "世尊，您以无上智慧的教化启迪众生，让诸位比丘和信徒们都蒙受殊胜法益，这实在是难得！您如此无私周全地护念一切众生，更是令人感佩。"

  - "世尊，弟子有个疑问：若有善男子、善女人发愿追求无上正等正觉之心，希望证得至高无上的圆满智慧，他们应当如何降伏心中纷扰的妄念，平息贪著执取的念头？"

  - 佛陀嘉许地回答：

  - "问得好啊，须菩提！正如你所说，如来确实以最殊胜的法义滋养诸弟子，以无上的智慧教导诸弟子。如来时刻不忘护念所有修行者。现在请你专心谛听，我将为你解答这个问题。"

  - "若有善男子、善女人发愿追求无上正等正觉之心，希望证得至高无上的圆满智慧，想要止息妄念、降伏执著，就当遵循我接下来要说的道理。依此修行者，必能消除分别妄想与贪欲执著。通过信受奉行我将宣说的妙法，必定能证得清净安宁的觉悟境界。"

  - 于是佛陀面向与会大众，开始宣说妙法。

* **大乘正宗分第三**
  - 佛告须菩提："诸菩萨摩诃萨，应如是降伏其心：若有一切众生之类，若卵生，若胎生，若湿生，若化生，若有色，若无色，若有想，若无想，若非有想非无想，我皆令入无余涅槃而灭度之。如是灭度无量无数无边众生，实无众生得灭度者。何以故？须菩提，若菩萨有我相、人相、众生相、寿者相，即非菩萨。"

* **Chapter 03**
  - "All living beings, whether born from eggs, from the womb, from moisture, or spontaneously; whether they have form or do not have form; whether they are aware or unaware, whether they are not aware or not unaware, all living beings will eventually be led by me to the final Nirvana, the final ending of the cycle of birth and death. And when this unfathomable, infinite number of living beings have all been liberated, in truth not even a single being has actually been liberated."
  - "Why Subhuti? Because if a disciple still clings to the arbitrary illusions of form or phenomena such as an ego, a personality, a self, a separate person, or a universal self existing eternally, then that person is not an authentic disciple."

* **大乘正宗分第三·译文**
  - 佛陀继续说道：

  - "一切众生，无论是卵生、胎生、湿生还是化生；无论是有形有相，还是无形无相；无论是有意识思维，或是无意识思维，乃至非有想非无想的众生，我都将引导他们进入究竟涅槃，永断生死轮回。当这无量无数无边的众生都得到度化之时，实际上并没有一个众生真正被度化。"

  - "知道为什么吗？须菩提。因为如果修行者还执着于'我'、'人'、'众生'、'寿者'这些相对的幻象——比如认为有真实的自我、独立的个体、恒常不变的主体，或者执着于任何形相概念，那么这样的人就不能称为真正的修行者。"

---
* **妙行无住分第四**
  - "复次，须菩提，菩萨于法应无所住，行于布施。所谓不住色布施，不住声、香、味、触、法布施。须菩提，菩萨应如是布施，不住于相。何以故？若菩萨不住相布施，其福德不可思量。须菩提，于意云何？东方虚空可思量不？"

  - "不也，世尊。"

  - "须菩提，南西北方，四维上下虚空可思量不？"

  - "不也，世尊。"

  - "须菩提，菩萨无住相布施，福德亦复如是不可思量。须菩提，菩萨应如所教住。"

* **Chapter 04**
  - "Furthermore, Subhuti, in the practice of compassion and charity a disciple should be detached. That is to say, he should practice compassion and charity without regard to appearances, without regard to form, without regard to sound, smell, taste, touch, or any quality of any kind. Subhuti, this is how the disciple should practice compassion and charity. Why? Because practicing compassion and charity without attachment is the way to reaching the Highest Perfect Wisdom, it is the way to becoming a living Buddha."

  - "Subhuti, do you think that you can measure all of the space in the Eastern Heavens?"

  - "No, Most Honored One. One cannot possibly measure all of the space in the Eastern Heavens."

  - "Subhuti, can space in all the Western, Southern, and Northern Heavens, both above and below, be measured?"

  - "No, Most Honored One. One cannot possibly measure all the space in the Western, Southern, and Northern Heavens."

  - "Well, Subhuti, the same is true of the merit of the disciple who practices compassion and charity without any attachment to appearances, without cherishing any idea of form. It is impossible to measure the merit they will accrue. Subhuti, my disciples should let their minds absorb and dwell in the teachings I have just given."

* **妙行无住分第四·译文**
  - 佛陀又说："须菩提，菩萨在修行布施时，不应执着于任何表象。也就是说，应当不住于色声香味触法等一切现象而行布施。须菩提，菩萨应当这样修行无住相布施。为什么呢？因为无住相布施的功德，如同虚空般不可衡量，这样才能契入无上正等正觉。"

  - 佛陀问道："须菩提，你认为东方虚空的广阔能够度量吗？"
  - 须菩提回答："世尊，不能。东方虚空无边无际，不可度量。"

  - 佛陀又问："那么四方上下的一切虚空，可以度量吗？"
  - 须菩提答道："世尊，十方虚空皆不可量。"

  - 佛陀开示道："正是如此，须菩提。菩萨若能不执着于任何形相而行布施，其所获功德也像这样不可计量。须菩提，诸位弟子应当将我所说的教诲牢记于心，如实修持。"

---
* **如理实见分第五**
  - "须菩提，于意云何？可以身相见如来不？"

  - "不也，世尊。不可以身相得见如来。何以故？如来所说身相，即非身相。"

  - 佛告须菩提："凡所有相，皆是虚妄。若见诸相非相，即见如来。"


* **Chapter 05**
  - "Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Buddha be recognized by means of his bodily form?"

  - "No, Most Honored One, the Buddha cannot be recognized by means of his bodily form. Why? Because when the Buddha speaks of bodily form, it is not a real form, but only an illusion."

  - The Buddha then spoke to Subhuti: "All that has a form is illusive and unreal. When you see that all forms are illusive and unreal, then you will begin to perceive your true Buddha nature."

* **如理实见分第五·译文**
  * 佛祖问道："须菩提，你怎么看？可以通过三十二相、八十种好这些身体特征来认出发掘如来吗？"

  * 须菩提回答："不可以，世尊。不可以凭借身形相貌来见如来。为什么呢？因为如来所说的身相庄严，并非真实永恒的存在，只是因缘和合的假相。"

  * 佛陀于是告诉须菩提："一切有形有相的事物，都是虚幻不实的。若能透彻领悟所有现象的虚妄性，就在这个当下见证如来了来了。"

---
* **正信希有分第六**
  - 须菩提白佛言："世尊，颇有众生，得闻如是言说章句，生实信不？"

  - 佛告须菩提："莫作是说。如来灭后，后五百岁，有持戒修福者，于此章句能生信心，以此为实。当知是人，不于一佛、二佛、三四五佛而种善根，已于无量千万佛所种诸善根。闻是章句，乃至一念生净信者，须菩提，如来悉知悉见，是诸众生得如是无量福德。何以故？是诸众生，无复我相、人相、众生相、寿者相，无法相，亦无非法相。何以故？是诸众生，若心取相，即为著我、人、众生、寿者；若取法相，即著我、人、众生、寿者。何以故？若取非法相，即著我、人、众生、寿者。是故，不应取法，不应取非法。以是义故，如来常说：汝等比丘知我说法如筏喻者。法尚应舍，何况非法。"

* **Chapter 06**
  - Subhuti respectfully asked the lord Buddha, "Most Honored One! In the future, if a person hears this teaching, even if it is only a phrase or sentence, is it possible for that person to have a true faith and knowledge of Enlightenment awaken in their mind?"

  - "Without a doubt, Subhuti. Even 500 years after the Enlightenment of this Buddha there will be some who are virtuous and wise, and while practicing compassion and charity, will believe in the words and phrases of this Sutra and will awaken their minds purely. After they come to hear these teachings, they will be inspired with belief. This is because when some people hear these words, they will have understood intuitively that these words are the truth."

  - "But you must also remember, Subhuti, that such persons have long ago planted the seeds of goodness and merit that lead to this realization. They have planted the seeds of good deeds and charity not simply before one Buddhist temple, or two temples, or five, but before hundreds of thousands of Buddhas and temples. So when a person who hears the words and phrases of this Sutra is ready for it to happen, a pure faith and clarity can awaken within their minds."

  - "Subhuti, any person who awakens faith upon hearing the words or phrases of this Sutra will accumulate countless blessings and merit."

  - "How do I know this? Because this person must have discarded all arbitrary notions of the existence of a personal self, of other people, or of a universal self. Otherwise their minds would still grasp after such relative conceptions. Furthermore, these people must have already discarded all arbitrary notions of the non-existence of a personal self, other people, or a universal self. Otherwise, their minds would still be grasping at such notions. Therefore anyone who seeks total Enlightenment should discard not only all conceptions of their own selfhood, of other selves, or of a universal self, but they should also discard all notions of the non-existence of such concepts."

  - "When the Buddha explains these things using such concepts and ideas, people should remember the unreality of all such concepts and ideas. They should recall that in teaching spiritual truths the Buddha always uses these concepts and ideas in the way that a raft is used to cross a river. Once the river has been crossed over, the raft is of no more use, and should be discarded. These arbitrary concepts and ideas about spiritual things need to be explained to us as we seek to attain Enlightenment. However, ultimately these arbitrary conceptions can be discarded. Think Subhuti, isn't it even more obvious that we should also give up our conceptions of non-existent things?"

* **正信希有分第六·译文**
  - 须菩提恭敬地向佛陀请教："世尊！倘若后世有人听闻这样的佛法，哪怕只是一个章节、一句话，是否可能在此人心中生出真实的信心，开启觉悟的智慧呢？"

  - 佛陀肯定地回答："毋庸置疑，须菩提。即便在我灭度五百年后，仍会有具足德行与智慧的人，他们在践行慈悲布施时，若对此经文的字句产生净信，便能以纯净心开启觉悟。这些人听闻如是教法后，必将生起坚定的信念。因为他们直觉地领会到，这些言语即是终极真理。"

  - "但须菩提，你要你要明白，这样的人早在久远劫前就已种下通向觉悟的善根福德。他们所播种的善行与布施，并非供养过一尊佛、两尊佛乃至五尊佛，而是在千百亿佛前皆曾广植善缘。因此，当有人听到这部经典的教诲而心有所应时，纯净的信心与澄明的智慧自然会在其心中显现。"

  - "须菩提，凡是因听闻此经文章句而生起信念的人，所积累的福德的功德将浩瀚不可称量。"

  - "何以见得？因为此人必须已然舍弃'我相、人相、众生相、寿者相'的执着。若是心存'我能证果'、'他人可度'之类的分别念，便仍被困于相对概念的牢笼。更重要的是，他们还要超越'无我相、无人相'等否定概念的束缚——若执着于'无相'的概念，同样落入了新的窠臼。所以说，追求无上正等正觉的人，不仅要放下对自我、他人和宇宙实体的执着，连'不存在这些概念'的想法也应一并放下。"

  - "当如来用各种名相概念阐释真理时，修行人要明白所有这些教法都如指月之指，并非真相本身。应当记住，佛陀演说佛法就像用竹筏渡河，到达彼岸后，筏子便该舍弃。这些为了引导我们开悟而设立的暂时概念，最终都需要超越。想想吧须菩提，既然实相概念都要放下，那些建立在虚无之上的观念，难道不更应该舍弃吗？"

---
* **无得无说分第七**
  - "须菩提，于意云何？如来得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提耶？如来有所说法耶？"

  - 须菩提言："如我解佛所说义，无有定法名阿耨多罗三藐三菩提，亦无有定法如来可说。何以故？如来所说法，皆不可取、不可说，非法、非非法。所以者何？一切圣贤皆以无为法而有差别。"

* **Chapter 07**
  - Then Buddha asked Subhuti, "What do you think, Subhuti, has the Buddha arrived at the highest, most fulfilled, most awakened and enlightened mind? Does the Buddha teach any teaching?"

  - Subhuti replied, "As far as I have understood the lord Buddha's teachings, there is no independently existing object of mind called the highest, most fulfilled, awakened or enlightened mind. Nor is there any independently existing teaching that the Buddha teaches. Why? Because the teachings that the Buddha has realized and spoken of cannot be conceived of as separate, independent things and therefore cannot be described. The truth in them is uncontainable and inexpressible. It neither is, nor is it not. What does this mean? What this means is that Buddhas and disciples are not enlightened by a set method of teachings, but by an internally intuitive process which is spontaneous and is part of their own inner nature."

* **无得无说分第七·译文**
  - 佛陀接着问须菩提："你是怎么理解的？须菩提，如来是否证得了无上正等正觉？如来是否传授了具体的教法？"

  - 须菩提回答："据我所领会的佛陀教义来看，并不存在一个独立存在的实体可以被称为'无上正等正觉'。同样，也没有独立存在的教法可以说由佛陀传授。为什么呢？因为如来所证悟并演说的真理，不能被割裂为独立的个体来理解，所以也无法用语言完全描述。其中的真谛是超越语言文字的。它既不是确定的'存在'，也不是绝对的'不存在'。这是什么意思呢？意思是诸佛与弟子们的开悟，并非依靠某种固定的教法体系，而是通过内心本具的、自然而发的直观觉性。"

---
* **依法出生分第八**
  - "须菩提，于意云何？若人满三千大千世界七宝，以用布施，是人所得福德宁为多不？"

  - 须菩提言："甚多，世尊。何以故？是福德，即非福德性，是故如来说福德多。"

  - "若复有人于此经中受持，乃至四句偈等，为他人说，其福胜彼。何以故？须菩提，一切诸佛及诸佛阿耨多罗三藐三菩提法，皆从此经出。须菩提，所谓佛法者，即非佛法。"

* **Chapter 08**
  - "Let me ask you Subhuti? If a person filled over ten thousand galaxies with the seven treasures for the purpose of compassion, charity, and giving alms, would this person not gain great merit and spread much happiness?"

  - "Yes, Most Honored One. This person would gain great merit and spread much happiness, even though, in truth, this person does not have a separate existence to which merit could accrue. Why? Because this person's merit is characterized with the quality of not being merit."

  - The Buddha continued, "Then suppose another person understood only four lines of this Sutra, but nevertheless took it upon themselves to explain these lines to someone else. This person's merit would be even greater than the other person's. Why? Because all Buddhas and all the teachings and values of the highest, most fulfilled, most awakened minds arise from the teachings in this Sutra. And yet, even as I speak, Subhuti, I must take back my words as soon as they are uttered, for there are no Buddhas and there are no teachings."

* **依法出生分第八·译文**
  - 佛陀问道："须菩提，若有人以怜悯之心，将遍满十万大千世界的金、银、琉璃等七宝用来布施济众，此人所得的福德难道不多吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："世尊，此人所得福德确实不可思议。然而真正通达佛法的行者，明了福德本质也是缘起性空，不会执着于'我在积累功德'的念头。为什么呢？因为真正的福德并无'福德'的实在自性可言。"

  - 佛陀接着说："假如另有人仅仅领悟了这本经典中的四句偈语，却能发心为他人解说，这人所得的福德更要胜过前者。为何如此？因为十方三世一切诸佛及其无上正等正觉之法，皆从此经中生发。可是须菩提，正当我说这话时，立刻就要收回这句话——因为实质上既没有所谓的'佛'，也没有所谓的'法'。"

---
* **一相无相分第九**
  - "须菩提，于意云何？须陀洹能作是念：我得须陀洹果不？"

  - 须菩提言："不也，世尊。何以故？须陀洹名为入流，而无所入。不入色、声、香、味、触、法，是名须陀洹。"

  - "须菩提，于意云何？斯陀含能作是念：我得斯陀含果不？"

  - 须菩提言："不也，世尊。何以故？斯陀含名一往来，而实无往来，是名斯陀含。"

  - "须菩提，于意云何？阿那含能作是念：我得阿那含果不？"

  - 须菩提言："不也，世尊。何以故？阿那含名为不来，而实无不来，是故名阿那含。"

  - "须菩提，于意云何？阿罗汉能作是念：我得阿罗汉道不？"

  - 须菩提言："不也，世尊。何以故？实无有法名阿罗汉。世尊，若阿罗汉作是念：我得阿罗汉道，即为著我、人、众生、寿者。世尊，佛说我得无诤三昧，人中最为第一，是第一离欲阿罗汉。世尊，我不作是念：我是离欲阿罗汉。世尊，我若作是念：我得阿罗汉道，世尊则不说须菩提是乐阿兰那行者。以须菩提实无所行，而名须菩提，是乐阿兰那行。"

* **Chapter 09**
  - Buddha then asked, "What do you think, Subhuti, does one who has entered the stream which flows to Enlightenment, say 'I have entered the stream'?"

  - "No, Buddha", Subhuti replied. "A true disciple entering the stream would not think of themselves as a separate person that could be entering anything. Only that disciple who does not differentiate themselves from others, who has no regard for name, shape, sound, odor, taste, touch or for any quality can truly be called a disciple who has entered the stream."

  - Buddha continued, "Does a disciple who is subject to only one more rebirth say to himself, 'I am entitled to the honors and rewards of a Once-to-be-reborn.'?"

  - "No, Lord. 'Once-to-be-reborn' is only a name. There is no passing away, or coming into, existence. Only one who realizes this can really be called a disciple."

  - "Subhuti, does a venerable One who will never more be reborn as a mortal say to himself, 'I am entitled to the honor and rewards of a Non-returner.'?"

  - "No, Perfectly Enlightened One. A 'Non-returner' is merely a name. There is actually no one returning and no one not-returning."

  - "Tell me, Subhuti. Does a Buddha say to himself, 'I have obtained Perfect Enlightenment.'?"

  - "No, lord. There is no such thing as Perfect Enlightenment to obtain. If a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha were to say to himself, 'I am enlightened' he would be admitting there is an individual person, a separate self and personality, and would therefore not be a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha."

  - Subhuti then said, "Most Honored One! You have said that I, Subhuti, excel amongst thy disciples in knowing the bliss of Enlightenment, in being perfectly content in seclusion, and in being free from all passions. Yet I do not say to myself that I am so, for if I ever thought of myself as such then it would not be true that I escaped ego delusion. I know that in truth there is no Subhuti and therefore Subhuti abides nowhere, that he neither knows nor does he not know bliss, and that he is neither free from nor enslaved by his passions."

* **一相无相分第九·译文**
  - 佛陀接着问："须菩提，你怎么想？一位证入圣道之流、走向觉悟的行者，会心生'我已入圣流'的念头吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："不会的，世尊。真正的入流者不会有'我正在进入什么境界'的分别心。只有当修行者泯除人我差别，不再执着于名相、声音、香气、味道、触感和种种现象，才能称为真正的入流者。"

  - 佛陀继续问："那位只需经历一次轮回就能成就佛果的修行者，会认为自己'堪受一生补处的殊荣'吗？"

  - 须菩提答："世尊，所谓'一生补处'也只是假名。名。实际上并无真实的来去生灭，唯有洞彻这点的人才配称为圣者。"

  - "须菩提，那位不再受生于尘世的阿罗汉，会自称'我应得不来果位的荣耀'吗？"

  - "无上正等正觉的世尊，'不来者'不过是个名称。实则无来者亦无不来者。"

  - 佛陀追问："告诉我，须菩提，佛陀会暗自思忖'我已证得无上正等正觉'吗？"

  - 须菩提肃然应答："世尊，并无实有的'无上正等正觉'可得。倘若圆满觉悟的佛陀动念'我已觉悟'，便是落入了人我分别的妄见，那就不成其为圆满觉者了。"

  - 须菩提继而说道："至尊的佛陀！您曾说我在众多弟子中最能安住于解脱之乐，乐，怡然独处，远离烦恼。但我从不自以为如此，因为若存此念，便是尚未破除我执。我深知本质上并无实在的须菩提，因此须菩提不滞留在任何境相中，既不知晓亦非不知晓安乐，既未脱离也未受制于烦恼。"

---
* **庄严净土分第十**
  - 佛告须菩提："于意云何？如来昔在然灯佛所，于法有所得不？"

  - "不也，世尊。如来在然灯佛所，于法实无所得。"

  - "须菩提，于意云何？菩萨庄严佛土不？"

  - "不也，世尊。何以故？庄严佛土者，即非庄严，是名庄严。"

  - "是故，须菩提，诸菩萨摩诃萨，应如是生清净心，不应住色生心，不应住声、香、味、触、法生心，应无所住而生其心。须菩提，譬如有人，身如须弥山王，于意云何？是身为大不？"

  - 须菩提言："甚大，世尊。何以故？佛说非身，是名大身。"

* **Chapter 10**
  - The Buddha then continued, "What do you think, Subhuti? When I was in a previous life, with Dipankara Buddha, did I receive any definite teaching or attain any degree of self-control, whereby I later became a Buddha?"

  - "No, honorable one. When you were a disciple of Dipankara Buddha, in truth, you received no definite teaching, nor did you attain any definite degree of self-control."

  - "Subhuti, know also that if any Buddha would say, 'I will create a paradise,' he would speak falsely. Why? Because a paradise cannot be created nor can it not be uncreated."

  - "A disciple should develop a mind which is in no way dependent upon sights, sounds, smells, tastes, sensory sensations or any mental conceptions. A disciple should develop a mind which does not rely on anything."

  - "Therefore, Subhuti, the minds of all disciples should be purified of all thoughts that relate to seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, and discriminating. They should use their minds spontaneously and naturally, without being constrained by preconceived notions arising from the senses."

  - "Suppose, Subhuti, a man had an enormous body. Would the sense of personal existence he had also be enormous?"

  - "Yes, indeed, Buddha," Subhuti answered. "His sense of personal existence would be enormous. But the Buddha has taught that personal existence is just a name, for it is in fact neither existence nor non-existence. So it only has the name 'personal existence'."

* **庄严净土分第十·译文**
  - 佛陀继续垂询："须菩提，你作何想？往昔我侍奉燃灯古佛时，可曾获得某种确切的教法，或达到某种特定的修行境界，从而得以成佛的吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："世尊，您当年在燃灯佛座下修行时，实则未曾获得任何确定不变的教法，也未曾证得任何固定不变的境界。"

  - "须菩提，你也当知晓，若有佛陀宣称'我将创造净土'，即是妄语。为何？因为净土既非被创造之物，亦非本然存在之实体——它超越了'创造'与'非创造'的二元对立。"

  - "修行者应当培养不依附于色、声、香、味、触、法这六尘的心境。真正解脱的心灵，如同虚空般无所依托。"

  - "是故，须菩提，所有修行者的心念都应净化对见闻觉知等六尘的执着。他们应该让心灵如流水般自然运作，不被感官引发的固有概念所束缚。"

  - 佛陀设喻："譬如有人拥有巍巍庄严的身相。他所执着的'自我'概念也会随之增长吗？"

  - 须菩提即刻回应："诚然如此，世尊。但其我执愈盛，离道愈远。不过佛陀早已开示：所谓'自我'仅是假名，因其本质既非实存亦非虚无。故而仅以'自我存在'之名相称谓之。"

  - "须菩提，如恒河中所有沙数，如是沙等恒河，于意云何？是诸恒河沙宁为多不？"

  - 须菩提言："甚多，世尊，但诸恒河尚多无数，何况其沙。"

  - "须菩提，我今实言告汝，若有善男子、善女人，以七宝满尔所恒河沙数三千大千世界，以用布施，得福多不？"

  - 须菩提言："甚多，世尊。"

* **Chapter 11**
  - "Subhuti, if there were as many Ganges rivers as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges, would you say that the number of grains of sand in all those Ganges rivers would be very many?"

  - Subhuti answered, "Very many indeed, Most Honored One. If the number of Ganges rivers were that large, how much more so would be the number of grains of sand in all those Ganges rivers."

  - "Subhuti, I will declare a truth to you. If a good man or a good woman filled over ten thousand galaxies of worlds with the seven treasures for each grain of sand in all those Ganges rivers, and gave it all away for the purpose of compassion, charity and giving alms, would this man or woman not gain great merit and spread much happiness?"

  - Subhuti replied, "Very much so, Most Honored One."

  - "Subhuti, if after studying and observing even a single stanza of this Sutra, another person were to explain it to others, the happiness and merit that would result from this virtuous act would be far greater."

* **无为福胜分第十一·译文**
  - 佛陀又问："须菩提，倘若恒河之沙的数量等同于所有恒河的数目，你是否会说这些恒河中沙粒的总数多得不可计数？"

  - 须菩提回答："确实多不可计，世尊。单是恒河的数量就已无穷无尽，更何况所有恒河中的沙粒总数。"

  - 佛陀郑重宣告："须菩提，现在我要向你开示一个真理。如果有善男子、善女子，用遍满如上述沙数之三千大千世界的七宝来进行布施，他所获得的福德难道不多吗？"

  - 须菩提当即回应："非常多，世尊。"

  - 佛陀进而指出："但是须菩提，如果有人能够信受奉受奉行这部经中的任意一个四句偈，并为他人解说，这桩善举善举所带来的福德将远远超过前者。"

* **Chapter 12**
  - "Furthermore, Subhuti, if any person in any place were to teach even four lines of this Sutra, the place where they taught it would become sacred ground and would be revered by all kinds of beings. How much more sacred would the place become if that person then studied and observed the whole Sutra! Subhuti, you should know that any person who does that would surely attain something rare and profound. Wherever this Sutra is honored and revered there is a sacred site enshrining the presence of the Buddha or one of the Buddha's most venerable disciples."

* **尊重正教分第十二·译文**
  - 佛陀进一步开示："再者，须菩提，不论何时何地，只要有人宣讲此经哪怕是四句偈颂，此地即成神圣道场，一切天人阿修罗皆当礼敬供奉。何况有人能信受奉持全经章句！须菩提，你当明了，这样的修行者必将成就无比稀有难得的无上法宝。凡是奉持此经之处，即为诸佛坛城，等同有佛陀与其殊胜弟子驻锡的圣地。"

  - "须菩提，于意云何，如来有所说法不？"

  - 须菩提白佛言："世尊，如来无所说。"

  - 须菩提言："甚多，世尊"

* **Chapter 13**

  - Subhuti said to the Buddha, "By what name shall we know this Sutra, so that it can be honored and studied?"

  - The lord Buddha replied, "This Sutra shall be known as

  - 'The Diamond that Cuts through Illusion'.

  - By this name it shall be revered and studied and observed. What does this name mean? It means that when the Buddha named it, he did not have in mind any definite or arbitrary conception, and so named it. This Sutra is hard and sharp, like a diamond that will cut away all arbitrary conceptions and bring one to the other shore of Enlightenment."

  - "What do you think, Subhuti? Has the Buddha taught any definite teaching in this Sutra?"

  - "No lord, the Buddha has not taught any definite teaching in this Sutra."

  - "What do you think, Subhuti? Are there many particles of dust in this vast universe?"

  - Subhuti replied: "Yes, many, Most Honored One!"

  - "Subhuti, when the Buddha speaks of particles of dust, it does not mean I am thinking of any definite or arbitrary thought, I am merely using these words as a figure of speech. They are not real, only illusion. It is just the same with the word universe; these words do not assert any definite or arbitrary idea, I am only using the words as words."

  - "Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Buddha be perceived by means of his thirty  -two physical characteristics?"

  - "No, Most Honored One. The Buddha cannot be perceived by his thirty  -two physical characteristics. Why? Because the Buddha teaches that they are not real but are merely called the thirty  -two physical characteristics."

  - "Subhuti, if a good and faithful person, whether male or female, has, for the sake of compassion and charity, been sacrificing their life for generation upon generation, for as many generations as the grains of sands in 3,000 universes; and another follower has been studying and observing even a single section of this Sutra and explains it to others, that person's blessings and merit would be far greater."

* **如法受持分第十三·译文**
  - 须菩提问佛陀："我们应当以什么名字来称呼这部经典，以便后人恭敬受持？"

  - 佛陀告示："此经名为《金刚般若波罗蜜经》。以此名号，众生当时刻崇奉、研习并依法修行。这个名字有何深意？意为佛陀命名之时，心中并无任何固定不变的念想，因而如此立名。此法门坚利如金刚宝石，足以斩断一切虚妄分别，引渡众生抵达觉悟彼岸。"

  - "须菩提，你怎么认为？佛陀可曾在这部经中讲授任何固定不变的教法吗？"

  - "没有，世尊。佛陀并未在此经中传授任何确定不变的教义。"

  - "须菩提，你觉得这茫茫宇宙中的微尘数量多吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："确实极多，世尊！"

  - "须菩提，当我说微尘时，并非执着实有的微尘概念，只是借用名言作为方便表达。它们并非真实存在，只是幻化之名。所谓'宇宙'也是如此——这些言辞并非在界定某种实体，不过是假名施设。"

  - "须菩提，你怎么看？能否通过三十二种殊胜容貌来认识如来？"

  - "不能，世尊。不可凭三十二相见如来。为何？因为如来开示这些相状本非真实，只不过称之为三十二相罢了。"

  - "须菩提，若有善男子、善女子，以悲悯之心累世舍身布施，其次数堪比三千大千世界微尘总数；而另有修行者虽只受持此经片段却能为他人解说，后者所获的福德远胜前者。"

* **离相寂灭分第十四**
  - 尔时，须菩提闻说是经，深解义趣，涕泪悲泣而白佛言："希有，世尊！佛说如是甚深经典。我从昔来，所得慧眼，未曾得如是之经。世尊，若复有人得闻是经，信心清净，即生实相，当知是人，成就第一希有功德。世尊，是实相者，即是非相，是故如来说名实相。世尊，我今得闻如是经典，信解受持，不足为难。若当来世后五百岁，其有众生得闻是经，信解受持，是人即为第一希有。何以故？此人无我相，无人相，无众生相，无寿者相。所以者何？我相即是非相，人相、众生相、寿者相即是非相。何以故？离一切诸相，即名诸佛。"
  - 佛告须菩提："如是，如是。若复有人得闻是经，不惊，不怖，不畏，当知是人甚为希有。何以故？须菩提，如来说第一波罗蜜，即非第一波罗蜜，是名第一波罗蜜。"

  - "须菩提，忍辱波罗蜜，如来说非忍辱波罗蜜，是名忍辱波罗蜜。何以故？如我昔为歌利王割截身体，我于尔时，无我相，无人相，无众生相，无寿者相。何以故？我于往昔节节支解时，若有我相、人相、众生相、寿者相，应生嗔恨。

  - "须菩提，又念过去于五百世作忍辱仙人，于尔所世，无我相，无人相，无众生相，无寿者相。是故，须菩提，菩萨应离一切相，发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提心。不应住色生心，不应住声、香、味、触、法生心，应生无所住心。若心有住，即为非住。是故，佛说菩萨心不应住色布施。须菩提，菩萨为利益一切众生故，应如是布施。如来说一切诸相即是非相，又说一切众生即非众生。

  - "须菩提，如来是真语者、实语者、如语者、不诳语者、不异语者。须菩提，如来所得法，此法无虚无实。须菩提，若菩萨心住于法而行布施，如人入暗，即无所见；若菩萨心不住法而行布施，如人有目，日光明照，见种种色。

* **Chapter 14**

  - At that time, after listening to this Sutra, Subhuti had understood its profound meaning and was moved to tears.

  - He said, "What a rare and precious thing it is that you should deliver such a deeply profound teaching. Since the day I attained the eyes of understanding, thanks to the guidance of the Buddha, I have never before heard teachings so deep and wonderful as these. Most Honored One, if someone hears this Sutra, and has pure and clear confidence in it they will have a profound insight into the truth. Having perceived that profound insight, that person will realize the rarest kind of virtue. Most Honored One, that insight into the truth is essentially not insight into the truth, but is what the Buddha calls insight into the truth."

  - "Most Honored One, having listened to this Sutra, I am able to receive and retain it with faith and understanding. This is not difficult for me, but in ages to come – in the last five hundred years, if there is a person who hears this Sutra, who receives and retains it with faith and understanding, then that person will be a rare one, a person of most remarkable achievement. Such a person will be able to awaken pure faith because they have ceased to cherish any arbitrary notions of their own selfhood, other selves, living beings, or a universal self. Why? Because if they continue to hold onto arbitrary conceptions as to their own selfhood, they will be holding onto something that is non  -existent. It is the same with all arbitrary conceptions of other selves, living beings, or a universal self. These are all expressions of non  -existent things. Buddhas are Buddhas because they have been able to discard all arbitrary conceptions of form and phenomena, they have transcended all perceptions, and have penetrated the illusion of all forms."

  - The Buddha replied:

  - "So it is, Subhuti. Most wonderfully blest will be those beings who, on hearing this Sutra, will not tremble, nor be frightened, or terrified in any way. And why? The Buddha has taught this Sutra as the highest perfection. And what the Buddha teaches as the highest perfection, that also the innumerable Blessed Buddhas do teach. Therefore is it called the 'highest perfection'."

  - "Subhuti, when I talk about the practice of transcendent patience, I do not hold onto any arbitrary conceptions about the phenomena of patience, I merely refer to it as the practice of transcendent patience. And why is that? Because when, thousands of lifetimes ago, the Prince of Kalinga severed the flesh from my limbs and my body I had no perception of a self, a being, a soul, or a universal self. If I had cherished any of these arbitrary notions at the time my limbs were being torn away, I would have fallen into anger and hatred."

  - "I also remember Subhuti that during my five hundred previous lives I had used life after life to practice patience and to look upon my life humbly, as though I were a saint called upon to suffer humility. Even then my mind was free of arbitrary conceptions of the phenomena of my self, a being, a soul, or a universal self."

  - "Therefore, Subhuti, disciples should leave behind all distinctions of phenomena and awaken the thought of the attainment of Supreme Enlightenment. A disciple should do this by not allowing their mind to depend upon ideas evoked by the world of the senses – by not allowing their mind to depend upon ideas stirred by sounds, odors, flavors, sensory touch, or any other qualities. The disciple's mind should be kept independent of any thoughts that might arise within it. If the disciple's mind depends upon anything in the sensory realm it will have no solid foundation in any reality. This is why Buddha teaches that the mind of a disciple should not accept the appearances of things as a basis when exercising charity. Subhuti, as disciples practice compassion and charity for the welfare of all living beings they should do it without relying on appearances, and without attachment. Just as the Buddha declares that form is not form, so he also declares that all living beings are, in fact, not living beings."

* **离相寂灭分第十四·译文**
  - 此刻，听闻如是经义的须菩提，已然洞悉其中甚深奥义，不由得悲欣交集、潸然泪下。

  - 他虔诚禀白："世尊！您所宣说的无上妙法实属罕有！自从我得慧眼以来，承蒙佛陀指引，从未听过如此深邃绝妙的教法。世尊，倘若有众生得闻此经，生起清净不疑的信心，便能照见万法实相。若能证见此真实相，此人即成就最殊胜稀有的功德。世尊，这般真实洞见，究其本质已非寻常认知范畴内的'洞见'，而这才是如来所称的真正洞见。"

  - "世尊，今日亲闻此经，我能以信心清净受持读诵。这对我倒不算难事，但在未来浊世——尤其是您涅槃后的最后五百年，若有众生听闻此经并能信解受持，此人当为凤毛麟角之辈，堪称载道之器。这样的人之所以能生起纯净信念，正因他们已放下了对我相、人相、众生相、寿者相的执着。何以故？若他们还抱着这些虚妄分别，便是在追逐本不存在的幻影。但凡所有基于名相的概念，诸如自我、他人、众生、宇宙本体等等，其实质皆为皆为非真实存在。诸佛之所以成佛，正是因他们彻底摆脱了对一切形式和现象的执着，超越所有感知局限，照破一切有为法的虚妄本质。"

  - 佛陀印可说：

  - "诚然如是，须菩提。那些闻此经义心无惊惧、毫不退转的众生，将获得无上福祉。何以故？如来所说最高圆满之法，实乃十方三世一切诸佛共同印证之道，故称为'无上圆满'。"

  - "须菩提，当我提及忍辱波罗密的修行时，心中并不执着于任何关于忍耐现象的设定，仅仅是假名之为忍辱修行。这又是为何？忆及千劫千劫前，歌利王肢解我身时，我那时已无我相、人相、众生相、寿者相。倘若当时心存这些分别念，在被节节支解时便会生起嗔恨。"

  - "我还记得，须菩提，在过去五百世修行中，我曾生生世世修习安忍，谦卑处世犹如圣者甘忍屈辱。即便在那时，我的心念也已远离对自我、众生、灵魂或宇宙本体的种种设定。"

  - "是故须菩提，修行者应当超越一切现象界的分别，发起求证无上菩提之心。要达到这种境界，就必须让心识不依赖于感官世界引发的各种概念——不让心识受到声色香味触法等尘境的影响。弟子的心应当始终保持独立，不随境转。若心念依附于任何感官对象，便失去了安住在实相上的根基。因此佛陀教导：修行者在践行慈悲利生时，不应以色尘等现象为依据，更不可产生丝毫执着。正如佛陀所言'诸相非相'，同理，一切众生本质上亦非众生。"

  - "须菩提，以要言之，是经有不可思议、不可称量无边功德。如来为发大乘者说，为发最上乘者说。若有人能受持、读诵、广为人说，如来悉知是人，悉见是人，皆得成就不可量、不可称、无有边、不可思议功德。如是人等，即为荷担如来阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。"

  - "Subhuti, if on the one hand, a son or daughter of a good family gives up his or her life in the morning as many times as there are grains of sand in the Ganges river as an act of generosity, and gives as many again in the afternoon and as many again in the evening, and continues doing so for countless ages; and if, on the other hand, another person listens to this Sutra with complete confidence and without contention, that person's happiness will be far greater. But the happiness of one who writes this Sutra down, receives, recites, and explains it to others cannot even be compared it is so great."

  - "Subhuti, we can summarize by saying that the merit and virtue of this Sutra is inconceivable, incalculable and boundless. The Buddha has declared this teaching for the benefit of initiates on the path to Enlightenment; he has declared it for the benefit of initiates on the path to Nirvana. If there is someone capable of receiving, practicing, reciting, and sharing this Sutra with others, the Buddha will see and know that person, and he or she will receive immeasurable, incalculable, and boundless merit and virtue. Such a person is known to be carrying the Supreme Enlightenment attained by the Buddha. Why? Subhuti, if a person is satisfied with lesser teachings than those I present here, if he or she is still caught up in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, or a universal self, then that person would not be able to listen to, receive, recite, or explain this Sutra to others."

  - "Subhuti, wherever this Sutra shall be observed, studied and explained, that place will become sacred ground to which countless spiritually advanced beings will bring offerings. Such places, however humble they may be, will be revered as though they were famous temples, and countless pilgrims will come there to worship. Such a place is a shrine and should be venerated with formal ceremonies, and offerings of flowers and incense. That is the power of this Sutra."

* **持经功德分第十五·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示："须菩提，倘若善男子、善女子在清晨时分以身躯布施，次数多如恒河沙数；午后、黄昏又各施同等次数，且经无量劫坚持不舍——但若有另一人闻此经义生起净信，并能受持诵读、为他人解说，后者所获得的法喜远比前者殊胜。"

  - "须菩提，总而言之，此经所蕴含的功德利益实乃不可思量、不可称计、无有边际。如来宣说此法，是为利益趋向觉醒之路的发心者，是为利益趋向涅槃之道的修行者。若有人能信受奉持、读诵演说此经，如来悉知是人、悉见是人，皆得成就无可估量的殊胜功德。这样的人，可谓荷担如来无上正等正觉。何以故？须菩提，若有人耽溺于小法浅见，尚执着于我相、人相、众生相、寿者相之人，则不可能听闻、受持、读诵此经，更遑论为人解说。"

  - "须菩提，凡是能够信奉、研读、讲说此经之处，此地即成圣域，无数具德天众皆来供养。纵是茅蓬柴扉，亦如宝刹精舍，万千信众自当虔心朝礼。这等所在即是佛塔道场，应以香花璎珞庄严供养，此乃般若法门之威神力。"

* **Chapter 16**
  - "Furthermore, Subhuti, if a good man or good woman who accepts, upholds, reads or recites this Sutra is disdained or slandered, if they are despised or insulted, it means that in prior lives they committed evil acts and as a result are now suffering the fruits of their actions. When their prior life's evil acts have finally been dissolved and extinguished, he or she will attain the supreme clarity of the most fulfilled, and awakened mind."

  - "Subhuti, in ancient times before I met Dipankara Buddha, I had made offerings to and had been attendant of all 84,000 million Buddhas. If someone is able to receive, recite, study, and practice this Sutra in a later, more distant age, then the happiness and merit brought about by this virtuous act would be hundreds of thousands of times greater than that which I brought about by my service to the Buddhas in ancient times. In fact, such happiness and merit cannot be conceived or compared with anything, even mathematically. If I were to explain all this in detail now some people might become suspicious and disbelieving, and their minds may even become disoriented or confused. Subhuti, you should know that the meaning of this Sutra is beyond conception and discussion. Likewise, the fruit resulting from receiving and practicing this Sutra is beyond conception and discussion."

* **能净业障分第十六·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示："再者，须菩提，若有善男子、善女子受持读诵此经，却遭轻蔑诽谤，受人冷眼侮辱，这说明他们往昔造作的恶业正在承受相应的苦报。等到前世恶业的因果终于消尽，他们必将在清净觉悟中获得无上正等正觉。"

  - "须菩提，忆念往昔我值遇燃灯佛之前，曾恭敬供养八万四千亿佛，悉心承事无有遗漏。但若有人在后世末法时代，能对此经受持读诵、如法修行，那么这份善举带来的福泽，将千万倍于我往昔供养诸佛的功德。事实上，这般的福德根本无法用思议揣度，乃至用数字比较也都不能及。倘若我现在详细阐述这些，恐怕有人会心生狐疑，甚至心智迷乱。须菩提，你当明白此经义理超越一切思维推度和言语议论。同样，依此经修行所得的果报，也是不可思议、不可言说的。"

  - 须菩提言："世尊，如来说人身长大，即为非大身，是名大身。"

  - "须菩提，菩萨亦如是。若作是言，我当灭度无量众生，即不名菩萨。何以故？须菩提，实无有法名为菩萨。是故，佛说一切法无我、无人、无众生、无寿者。

  - "须菩提，若菩萨作是言，我当庄严佛土，是不名菩萨。何以故？如来说庄严佛土者，即非庄严，是名庄严。须菩提，若菩萨通达无我法者，如来说名真是菩萨。"

* **Chapter 17**
  - At that time, the venerable Subhuti then asked the Buddha, "World  -Honored One, may I ask you a question again? If sons or daughters of a good family want to develop the highest, most fulfilled and awakened mind, if they wish to attain the Highest Perfect Wisdom, what should they do to help quiet their drifting minds and master their thinking?"

  - The Buddha replied:

  - "Subhuti, a good son or daughter who wants to give rise to the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind must create this resolved attitude of mind: 'I must help to lead all beings to the shore of awakening, but, after these beings have become liberated, in truth I know that not even a single being has been liberated.' Why is this so? If a disciple cherishes the idea of a self, a person, a living being or a universal self, then that person is not an authentic disciple. Why? Because in fact there is no independently existing object of mind called the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind."

  - "What do you think, Subhuti? In ancient times, when the Buddha was living with Dipankara Buddha, did he attain anything called the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind?"

  - "No, Most Honored One. According to what I understand from the teachings of the Buddha, there is no attaining of anything called the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind."

  - The Buddha said:

  - "You are correct, Subhuti. In fact, there does not exist any so  -called highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind that the Buddha attains. Because if there had been any such thing, Dipankara Buddha would not have predicted of me, 'In the future, you will come to be a Buddha known as The Most Honored One'. This prediction was made because there is, in fact, nothing to be attained. Someone would be mistaken to say that the Buddha has attained the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind because there is no such thing as a highest, most fulfilled, or awakened mind to be attained."

  - "Subhuti, a comparison can be made with the idea of a large human body. What would you understand me to mean if I spoke of a 'large human body'?"

  - "I would understand that the lord Buddha was speaking of a 'large human body' not as an arbitrary conception of its being, but as a series of words only. I would understand that the words carried merely an imaginary meaning. When the Buddha speaks of a large human body, he uses the words only as words."

  - "Subhuti, it is just the same when a disciple speaks of liberating numberless sentient beings. If they have in mind any arbitrary conception of sentient beings or of definite numbers, then they are unworthy of being called a disciple. Subhuti, my teachings reveal that even such a thing as is called a 'disciple' is non  -existent. Furthermore, there is really nothing for a disciple to liberate."

  - "A true disciple knows that there is no such thing as a self, a person, a living being, or a universal self. A true disciple knows that all things are devoid of selfhood, devoid of any separate individuality."

  - To make this teaching even more emphatic, the lord Buddha continued,

  - "If a disciple were to speak as follows, 'I have to create a serene and beautiful Buddha field', that person is not yet truly a disciple. Why? What the Buddha calls a 'serene and beautiful Buddha field' is not in fact a serene and beautiful Buddha field. And that is why it is called a serene and beautiful Buddha field. Subhuti, only a disciple who is wholly devoid of any conception of separate selfhood is worthy of being called a disciple."

* **究竟无我分第十七·译文**
  - 这时，尊者须菩提再度请示佛陀："世尊，善男子、善女子若发心求无上正等正觉，应当如何安住飘忽不定的心念，如何降服妄念思绪？"

  - 佛陀开示道：

  - "须菩提，发心求无上正等正觉者，应当生起这样的决心：'我誓愿度化一切众生达至觉悟彼岸，但当众生皆得度化时，须了知实无任一众生被度化。为何如此？若修行者心存'我相、人相、众生相、寿者相'，则非真正的菩萨。因为实际上并不存在一个独立存在的实体可称为'无上正等正觉之心'。"

  - "须菩提，你以为如何？往昔我亲近燃灯古佛时，可曾获得名为'无上正等正觉'的实法吗？"

  - "不曾，世尊。依我对佛陀教法的理解，本来就没有某个叫'无上正等正觉'的境界可得。因为若有实在的果位可得，燃灯佛就不会为我授记：'汝于来世当得作佛，号释迦牟尼'。此授记成立的前提，恰恰是因为根本没有任何实在的果位可得。若有人说'佛陀证得了无上正等正觉'，这是一种谬误见解，因为所谓的'无上正等正觉'本身就是假名施设。"

  - 佛陀又说：

  - "须菩提，譬如有人说'伟岸人身'。你若听我这么说，该如何理解？"

  - "我会明白世尊所说的'伟岸人身'并非指实有的躯体，只是名言概念。我理解这些词语仅具有符号意义。"

  - "须菩提，同样的道理，若菩萨声称要度化无量众生，但心中却执着'众生'与'数量'的概念，那就不配称为菩萨。须菩提，我的教法表明：就连'菩萨'这个概念本身也是空无自性的。而且，实际上并没有什么众生需要被度化。"

  - "真正的修行者了知：根本没有实存的'我'、'人'、'众生'、'寿者'的独立实体。真正的修行者明白万法皆空，无有独立自性。"

  - 为使教法更为明晰，佛陀继续宣说：

  - "若菩萨这样说：'我要建设庄严佛土'，此人还未成为真正的菩萨。为何？因为如来所说的'庄严佛土'，本质上并非真实存在的清净国土，所以才称之为庄严佛土。须菩提，唯有全然舍弃'我执'分别的修行者，才配称为菩萨。"

* **Chapter 18**
  - The Buddha then asked Subhuti, "What do you think? Does the Buddha have human eyes?"

  - "Subhuti replied, "Yes, he has human eyes."

  - "Does he have the eyes of Enlightenment?"

  - "Of course, the Buddha has the eyes of Enlightenment, otherwise he would not be the Buddha."

  - "Does the Buddha have the eyes of transcendent intelligence?"

  - "Yes, the Buddha has the eyes of transcendent intelligence."

  - "Does the Buddha have the eyes of spiritual intuition?"

  - "Yes, lord, the Buddha has the eyes of spiritual intuition."

  - "Does the Buddha have the eyes of love and compassion for all sentient beings?"

  - Subhuti agreed and said, "Lord, you love all sentient life."

  - "What do you think, Subhuti? When I referred to the grains of sand in the river Ganges, did I assert that they were truly grains of sand?"

  - "No blessed lord, you only spoke of them as grains of sand."

  - "Subhuti, if there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, and if there were as many buddhalands as there are grains of sand in all those innumerable rivers, would these buddhalands be considered numerous?"

  - "Very numerous indeed, lord Buddha."

  - "Subhuti, I know the mind of every sentient being in all the host of universes, regardless of any modes of thought, conceptions or tendencies. For all modes, conceptions and tendencies of thought are not mind. And yet they are called 'mind'. Why? It is impossible to retain a past thought, to seize a future thought, and even to hold onto a present thought."

* **一体同观分第十八·译文**
  - 佛陀又问须菩提："你以为如何？如来是否有肉眼？"

  - 须菩提答："是的，如来有肉眼。"

  - "是否有慧眼？"

  - "当然，如来有慧眼，否则不成其为佛。"

  - "是否有法眼？"

  - "是的，世尊，如来具足法眼。"

  - "是否有佛眼？"

  - "世尊，如来确有佛眼。"

  - "佛陀是否具备慈视一切有情的大悲之眼？"

  - 须菩提恭敬回应："世尊，您以无缘大慈摄护众生。"

  - "须菩提，你怎么想？当我说恒河中的沙粒时，是否意指它们是真实的沙子？"

  - "不，世尊，您只是假借沙粒之名相而言说。"

  - "须菩提，假使有像恒河沙数那样多的恒河，又有像所有这些恒河沙数那样多的佛土，这些佛土算得上多吗？"

  - "确实多得不可计量，世尊。"

  - "须菩提，我了知无量世界中一切众生的每一个心念，不论何种思维模式、概念或倾向。然而所有的思维模式、概念和倾向都不是真心。它们只是被称作'心念'。为何如此？过去的念头不可追回，未来的念头无从捕捉，即便是当下的心念也难以把捉停留。"

  - The Buddha continued:

  - "What do you think Subhuti? If a follower were to give away enough treasures to fill 3,000 universes, would a great blessing and merit incur to him or her?"

  - Subhuti replied, "Honored one, such a follower would acquire considerable blessings and merit."

  - The lord Buddha said:

  - "Subhuti, if such a blessing had any substantiality, if it were anything other than a figure of speech, the Most Honored One would not have used the words 'blessings and merit'."

  - "须菩提，你以为如何？若有修行者布施足以充满三千大千世界的珍宝，此人是否能获得巨大的福报功德？"

  - 须菩提回答："世尊，这样的修行者确实会获得极大的福报功德。"

* **Chapter 20**
  - "Subhuti, what do you think, should one look for Buddha in his perfect physical body?"

  - "No, Perfectly Enlightened One, one should not look for Buddha in his perfect physical body. Why? The Buddha has said that the perfect physical body is not the perfect physical body. Therefore it is called the perfect physical body."

  - "Subhuti, what do you think, should one look for Buddha in all his perfect appearances?"

  - "No Most Honored One, one should not look for Buddha in all his perfect appearances. Why? The Buddha has said perfect appearances are not perfect appearances. Therefore they are called perfect appearances."

* **离色离相分第二十·译文**
  - 佛陀问道："须菩提，你怎么认为？人们是否应该通过完美庄严的身体形象来寻觅佛陀？"

  - 须菩提回答："无上正等正觉的世尊，不应该依外貌觅如来。原因何在？因为如来曾经说过，完美的形体并非真实的完美形体，所以才称之为完美的形体。"

  - 佛陀又问："须菩提，那你觉得，世人是否应该凭借一切完满的相好来认识佛陀？"

  - 须菩提恭敬答道："不应如此，世尊。不可以凭外在形相见如来。为何？如来所说的完满相好，本质上并非真实的相好，因此才称作完满相好。"

  - 佛言："须菩提，彼非众生，非不众生。何以故？须菩提，众生众生者，如来说非众生，是名众生。"

* **Chapter 21**
  - "Subhuti, do not maintain that the Buddha has this thought: 'I have spoken spiritual truths.' Do not think that way. Why? If someone says the Buddha has spoken spiritual truths, he slanders the Buddha due to his inability to understand what the Buddha teaches. Subhuti, as to speaking truth, no truth can be spoken. Therefore it is called 'speaking truth'."

  - At that time Subhuti, the wise elder, addressed the Buddha, "Most Honored One, will there be living beings in the future who believe in this Sutra when they hear it?"

  - The Buddha said:

  - "The living beings to whom you refer are neither living beings nor not living beings. Why? Subhuti, all the different kinds of living beings the Buddha speaks of are not living beings. But they are referred to as living beings."

* **非说所说分第二十一·译文**
  - 佛陀询问："须菩提，你怎么想？人们是否应该从完美庄严的色身形象中寻找佛陀？"

  - 须菩提回答："无上正等正觉的世尊，不应从色身形相当中寻觅如来。原因何在？因为佛陀曾开示：所谓的完美色身并非实有的完美色身，所以才给予'完美色身'这个名称。"

  - 佛陀继续追问："须菩提，那你认为，是否应该通过一切圆满无缺的相好来认识佛陀？"

* **Chapter 22**
  - Subhuti again asked, "Blessed lord, when you attained complete Enlightenment, did you feel in your mind that nothing had been acquired?"

  - The Buddha replied:

  - "That is it exactly, Subhuti. When I attained total Enlightenment, I did not feel, as the mind feels, any arbitrary conception of spiritual truth, not even the slightest. Even the words 'total Enlightenment' are merely words, they are used merely as a figure of speech."

* **无法可得分第二十二·译文**
  - 须菩提再次请益：「世尊，您证得无上正等正觉时，心中是否觉得有所获得？」

  - 佛陀答道：

  - 「正是如此，须菩提。我在成就无上菩提时，心中没有丝毫'我已证得无上正等正觉'的念头。因为如果有这样的念头，便是执着于'我相、人相、众生相、寿者相，那就偏离了真正的觉悟。」

* **Chapter 23**
  - "Furthermore Subhuti, what I have attained in total Enlightenment is the same as what all others have attained. It is undifferentiated, regarded neither as a high state, nor a low state. It is wholly independent of any definite or arbitrary conceptions of an individual self, other selves, living beings, or a universal self."

  - "Subhuti, when someone is selflessly charitable, they should also practice being ethical by remembering that there is no distinction between one's self and the selfhood of others. Thus one practices charity by giving not only gifts, but through kindness and sympathy. Practice kindness and charity without attachment and you can become fully enlightened."

  - "Subhuti, what I just said about kindness does not mean that when someone is being charitable they should hold onto arbitrary conceptions about kindness, for kindness is, after all, only a word and charity needs to be spontaneous and selfless, done without regard for appearances."

* **净心行善分第二十三·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示："须菩提，还有一点很重要：我所证得的无上正等正觉，与其他一切诸佛所证平等无异。这其中没有高低之分，因为它完全不依赖任何关于自我、他人、众生或宇宙本体的固定概念。"

  - "须菩提，当一个人行无私布施时，更应持守清净戒律，但要明白自己的本性与他人的本性原本没有区别。所以不仅要以财物行布施，更要以慈悲心行无畏施。怀着无执着的心修习慈悲与布施，方能臻至圆满觉悟。"

  - "须菩提，我刚才提到的慈悲，并不意味着有人在行布施时应拘泥于某些特定概念。因为说到底，"慈悲"也不过是一个词语，真正的布施应当是自然而然、无我无私的，不为任何表面现象所牵绊。"

* **Chapter 24**
  - "Subhuti, if a person collected treasures as high as 3,000 of the highest mountains, and gave them all to others, their merit would be less than what would accrue to another person who simply observed and studied this Sutra and, out of kindness, explained it to others. The latter person would accumulate hundreds of times the merit, hundreds of thousands of millions of times the merit. There is no conceivable comparison."

* **福智无比分第二十四·译文**
  - 佛陀说："须菩提，假使有人堆积珍宝高如三千世界里最高的山峦，并将其全部施与他人，此人所得的功德，还不及另一位仅仅研习并心怀慈悲为他人解说此经的修行者。为什么？因为一切诸佛及其无上正等正觉之法，皆由此经流出。须菩提，所谓的佛法，并不是实有的佛法，所以才称之为佛法。"

  - "须菩提，如来说有我者，即非有我，而凡夫之人以为有我。须菩提，凡夫者，如来说既非凡夫，是名凡夫。"

* **Chapter 25**
  - "Subhuti, do not say that the Buddha has the idea, 'I will lead all sentient beings to Nirvana.' Do not think that way, Subhuti. Why? In truth there is not one single being for the Buddha to lead to Enlightenment. If the Buddha were to think there was, he would be caught in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, or a universal self. Subhuti, what the Buddha calls a self essentially has no self in the way that ordinary persons think there is a self. Subhuti, the Buddha does not regard anyone as an ordinary person. That is why he can speak of them as ordinary persons."

* **化无所化分第二十五·译文**
  - 佛陀告诫道："须菩提，你不要认为佛陀有这样的念头：'我应当救度一切众生进入涅槃。'切莫这样想。为什么呢？因为根本上并没有一个独立的'众生'需要被度化。倘若佛陀执着于此念，便陷入了'我相我相、人相、众生相、寿者相'的分别之中。须菩提，如来所说的'我'，本质上不同于凡夫所执着的那个实有的'我'。正因为如来已经超越这些分别，他才可以用'凡夫'这个名称来称呼众生。"

* **Chapter 26**
  - Then the Buddha inquired of Subhuti:

  - "What do you think Subhuti? Is it possible to recognize the Buddha by the 32 physical marks?"

  - Subhuti replied, "Yes, Most Honored One, the Buddha may thus be recognized."

  - "Subhuti, if that were true then Chakravartin, the mythological king who also had the 32 marks, would be called a Buddha."

  - Then Subhuti, realizing his error, said, "Most Honored One, now I realize that the Buddha cannot be recognized merely by his 32 physical marks of excellence."

  - The Buddha then said:

  - "Should anyone, looking at an image or likeness of the Buddha, claim to know the Buddha and worship him, that person would be mistaken, not knowing the true Buddha."

* **法身非相分第二十六·译文**
  - 佛陀问须菩提："你怎么看？能否通过三十二种显著的身体特征来辨认佛陀？"

  - 须菩提起初回答："是的，世尊，或许可以通过这些特征来认出佛陀。"

  - 佛陀立即点拨："须菩提，若果真如此，那么转轮圣王也具有这三十二相，他也该被称为佛陀了。"

  - 须菩提闻言立即醒悟，恭敬地说："世尊，现在我明白了，不能仅仅依靠身体上的三十二种殊胜相貌来认识如来。"

  - 佛陀遂开示道：

  - "如果有人看见佛像或佛陀的形象，就以为认识了佛陀并加以崇拜，这个人就走上了歧路，因为他未能见到真正的佛陀。"

* **Chapter 27**
  - "However, Subhuti, if you think that the Buddha realizes the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind and does not need to have all the marks, you are mistaken. Subhuti, do not think in that way. Do not think that when one gives rise to the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind, one needs to see all objects of mind as nonexistent, cut off from life. Please do not think in that way. One who gives rise to the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind does not contend that all objects of mind are nonexistent and cut off from life. That is not what I say."

* **无断无灭分第二十七·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "但是须菩提，如果你认为'如来证得了无上正等正觉，所以不需要具备这些相好'，这也是错误的见解。须菩提，千万不要这样想。切勿认为发起了无上菩提心就意味着要将一切心念对象视为断绝生命的不存在。请你不要这样理解。发无上菩提心的人，绝不应当固执地认定一切事物都是虚无断灭的。这不是我说的真义。"

  - 须菩提白佛言："世尊，云何菩萨不受福德？"

  - "须菩提，菩萨所作福德，不应贪著，是故说不受福德。"

* **Chapter 28**
  - The lord Buddha continued:

  - "Subhuti, if someone gives treasures equal to the number of sands on the shores of the Ganges river, and if another, having realized the egolessness of all things, thereby understands selflessness, the latter would be more blessed than the one who practiced external charity. Why? Because great disciples do not see blessings and merit as a private possession, as something to be gained."

  - Subhuti inquired of the lord Buddha, "What do you mean 'great disciples do not see blessings and merit as a private possession'?"

  - The Buddha replied:

  - "Because those blessings and merit have never been sought after by those great disciples, they do not see them as private possessions, but they see them as the common possession of all beings."

* **不受不贪分第二十八·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "须菩提，如果有人布施相当于恒河岸边所有沙粒数量的珍宝，而另一个人通过认识到万物皆无自性，从而理解了无我之理，那么后者的福报将远超前者。何以故？因为真正的菩萨不见福德为私有，不将功德视为可获取的资产。"

  - 菩提请教佛陀："您说'菩萨不见福德为私有'是何深意？"

  - 佛陀解答道：

  - "因为真正的修行者从来不刻意追求这些福德，所以他们不将其视为私产，反而把这些福报看作是一切众生共有的财富。"

* **Chapter 29**
  - The Buddha said:

  - "Subhuti, if any person were to say that the Buddha is now coming or going, or sitting up or lying down, they would not have understood the principle I have been teaching. Why? Because while the expression 'Buddha' means 'he who has thus come, thus gone,' the true Buddha is never coming from anywhere or going anywhere. The name 'Buddha' is merely an expression, a figure of speech."

* **威仪寂静分第二十九·译文**
  - 佛陀开示：

  - "须菩提，倘若有人认为：如来有来有去，或坐或卧，此等人未能领会我所说的真义。为什么呢？所谓如来，既无所谓从哪里来，也无所谓到哪里去，所以才称为如来。"

  - 须菩提言："甚多，世尊。何以故？若是微尘众实有者，佛即不说是微尘众。所以者何？佛说微尘众，即非微尘众，是名微尘众。世尊，如来所说三千大千世界，即非世界，是名世界。何以故？若世界实有者，即是一合相，如来说一合相，即非一合相，是名一合相。"

  - "须菩提，一合相者，即是不可说。但凡夫之人，贪着其事。"

* **Chapter 30**
  - The lord Buddha resumed:

  - "Subhuti, if any good person, either man or woman, were to take 3,000 galaxies and grind them into microscopic powder and blow it into space, what do you think, would this powder have any individual existence?"

  - Subhuti replied, "Yes, lord, as a microscopic powder blown into space, it might be said to have a relative existence, but as you use words, it has no existence. The words are used only as a figure of speech. Otherwise the words would imply a belief in the existence of matter as an independent and self  -existent thing, which it is not."

  - "Furthermore, when the Most Honored One refers to the '3,000 galaxies,' he could only do so as a figure of speech. Why? Because if the 3,000 galaxies really existed, their only reality would consist in their cosmic unity. Whether as microscopic powder or as galaxies, what does it matter? Only in the sense of the cosmic unity of ultimate being can the Buddha rightfully refer to it."

  - The lord Buddha was very pleased with this reply and said:

  - "Subhuti, although ordinary people have always grasped after an arbitrary conception of matter and galaxies, the concept has no true basis; it is an illusion of the mortal mind. Even when it is referred to as 'cosmic unity' it is unthinkable and unknowable."

* **一合理相分第三十·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "须菩提，若有善男子、善女人，将三千大千世界碎为微尘，你认为这些微尘还具有独立的存在性吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："世尊，这些微尘在相对层面上可以说存在，但从您的教法来看，这些都只是假名安立而已。语言文字只是权宜之说，否则就会让人误以为物质是独立永恒的存在——而事实并非如此。"

  - "再者，当您提到'三千大千世界'时，这也只是一种比喻。为什么呢？因为如果三千大千世界真的存在，它们的真实性也只存在于法性整体的层面。"

  - 佛陀对这个回答非常欣慰，赞叹道：

  - "须菩提，芸芸众生总是执着于物质和宇宙的实有概念，但这些概念并无真实基础，不过是凡夫心识的幻象。即使称之为'法性一体'，这个概念本身仍是不可思、不可知的。"

* **知见不生分第三十一**
  - "须菩提，若人言，佛说我见、人见、众生见、寿者见，须菩提，于意云何？是人解我所说义不？"

  - "不也，世尊，是人不解如来所说义。何以故？世尊说我见、人见、众生见、寿者见，即非我见、人见、众生见、寿者见，是名我见、人见众生见、寿者见。"

  - "须菩提，发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提心者，于一切法，应如是知、如是见、如是信解，不生法相。须菩提，所言法相者，如来说即非法相，是名法相。"

* **Chapter 31**
  - The lord Buddha continued:

  - "If any person were to say that the Buddha, in his teachings, has constantly referred to himself, to other selves, to living beings, or to a universal self, what do you think, would that person have understood my meaning?"

  - Subhuti replied, "No, blessed lord. That person would not have understood the meaning of your teachings. For when you refer to those things, you are not referring to their actual existence, you only use the words as figures of speech, as symbols. Only in that sense can words be used, for conceptions, ideas, limited truths, and spiritual truths have no more reality than have matter or phenomena."

  - Then the lord Buddha made his meaning even more emphatic by saying:

  - "Subhuti, when people begin their practice of seeking to attaining total Enlightenment, they ought to see, to perceive, to know, to understand, and to realize that all things and all spiritual truths are no  -things, and, therefore, they ought not to conceive within their minds any arbitrary conceptions whatsoever."

* **知见不生分第三十一**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "倘若有人说：佛陀在说法时，常常提到自我、他人、众生或宇宙本体。你认为此人是否真正理解了我的教法真义？"

  - 须菩提回答："不，世尊。此人尚未领会您教法的精髓。因为当您提及这些概念时，并非确认其实存，只是借用名言作为表法的工具。唯有如此看待语言，才能得其真实效用，因为一切概念、观念，乃至世俗真理与神圣真理，都比物质现象更加虚幻不实。"

  - 于是佛陀以更郑重的语气阐明真义：

  - "须菩提，当修行者开始修证无上正等正觉时，应当彻见、觉知、通达：一切事物与精神真理皆非实存，因此他们不该在心中生起任何固定的概念分别。"

* **应化非真分第三十二**
  - "须菩提，若有人以满无量阿僧祇世界七宝持用布施；若有善男子善女人发菩提心者，持于此经，乃至四句偈等，受持读诵、为人演说，其福胜彼。

  - "云何为人演说？不取于相，如如不动。何以故？

  - "一切有为法，

  - 如梦幻泡影，

  - 如露亦如电，

  - 应作如是观。"

  - 佛说是经已，长老须菩提及诸比丘、比丘尼、优婆塞、优婆夷，一切世间天、人、阿修罗，闻佛所说，皆大欢喜，信受奉行。

* **Chapter 32**
  - Buddha continued:

  - "Subhuti, if anyone gave to the Buddha an immeasurable quantity of the seven treasures sufficient to fill the whole universe; and if another person, whether a man or woman, in seeking to attain complete Enlightenment were to earnestly and faithfully observe and study even a single section of this Sutra and explain it to others, the accumulated blessing and merit of that latter person would be far greater."

  - "Subhuti, how can one explain this Sutra to others without holding in mind any arbitrary conception of forms or phenomena or spiritual truths? It can only be done, Subhuti, by keeping the mind in perfect tranquility and free from any attachment to appearances."

  - "So I say to you –

  - This is how to contemplate our conditioned existence in this fleeting world:"

  - "Like a tiny drop of dew, or a bubble floating in a stream;

  - Like a flash of lightning in a summer cloud,

  - Or a flickering lamp, an illusion, a phantom, or a dream."

  - "So is all conditioned existence to be seen."

  - Thus spoke Buddha.

* **应化非真分第三十二·译文**
  - "须菩提，假如有人以充满整个宇宙的无量七宝供养佛陀，而另一人——无论是男是女——为了求得无上正等正觉，能够以至诚心受持本经哪怕其中一个章节，并为他人解说，后者所积累的福德将远远超过前者。"

  - "须菩提，如何才能不执着于形相、现象或真理概念而为他人解说此经呢？要做到这一点，须菩提，只有让心安住于绝对的宁静，不受任何外相的束缚。"

  - "因此我告诉你们——

  - 应当这样观察我们所处的无常世界："

  - "如同草尖的露珠，亦如溪流中的水泡；

  - 好似夏日云层的闪电，

  - 又如摇曳的烛火，一切如同幻影、梦境。"

  - "一切因缘和合的现象都应作如是观。"

  - 佛陀如是宣说。

### 002. 心经
* **[心经 | 般若波罗蜜多心经](https://applenob.github.io/philosophy/heart_sutra/)**
* **原文**
  - 观自在菩萨，行深般若波罗蜜多时，照见五蕴皆空，度一切苦厄。
  - 舍利子，色不异空，空不异色；色即是空，空即是色。
  - 受、想、行、识，亦复如是。
  - 舍利子，是诸法空相，不生不灭，不垢不净，不增不减。
  - 是故空中无色，无受、想、行、识；
  - 无眼、耳、鼻、舌、身、意；
  - 无色、声、香、味、触、法；
  - 无眼界，乃至无意识界；
  - 无无明，亦无无明尽；
  - 乃至无老死，亦无老死尽。
  - 无苦、集、灭、道，无智亦无得。
  - 以无所得故，菩提萨埵，依般若波罗蜜多故，心无挂碍。
  - 无挂碍故，无有恐怖，远离颠倒梦想，究竟涅槃。
  - 三世诸佛，依般若波罗蜜多故，得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。
  - 故知般若波罗蜜多，是大神咒，是大明咒，是无上咒，是无等等咒，能除一切苦，真实不虚。
  - 故说般若波罗蜜多咒，即说咒曰："揭谛、揭谛，波罗揭谛，波罗僧揭谛，菩提萨婆诃。"

* **译文**
  - 观世音菩萨在深度修行智慧到彼岸的法门时，透彻觉悟到身心世界的五种构成元素本质是空的，从而解脱了一切苦难。

  - 舍利弗啊，物质形态与空性没有区别，空性与物质形态也没有区别；物质就是空，空就是物质。感受、思想、行为、意识这四方面，也都是同样的道理。

  - 舍利弗啊，一切现象的本质都是空性的：没有生起与消亡，没有污浊与清净，不会增加也不会减少。

  - 因此在这空性之中：没有物质形态，没有感受、思想、行为、意识；没有眼、耳、鼻、舌、身体、意念这些感官；没有形状颜色、声音气味、味道触感、概念法则这些认知对象；没有视觉感知的领域，直至没有意识感知的领域；没有根本的无明烦恼，也没有无明的终结；直到没有衰老死亡，也没有衰老死亡的终结。没有痛苦的现象、痛苦的起因、痛苦的止息、灭苦的途径，没有智慧也没有获得。

  - 正因为没有任何所得的缘故，觉悟者们依靠这智慧到彼岸的法门，内心清澈明朗毫无牵挂。因为没有牵挂障碍，所以不会有恐惧担忧，能够彻底摆脱错误认知和虚幻妄想，达到完全解脱的境界。过去、现在、未来的所有觉者，都是依靠这智慧到彼岸的法门，获得了无上正等正觉的圆满智慧。

  - 由此可知，智慧到彼岸的法门是具有伟大神力的密语，是照耀光明的密语，是最殊胜的密语，是无可比拟的密语，能够真实不虚地消除世间所有苦难。

  - 现在就说这智慧到彼岸的密语：（渡过去啊，渡过去，一起渡到彼岸去，愿我们共同抵达觉悟的彼岸！）

### 003. 心经释义
**一、核心主旨（一句话概括）**
- 《心经》的核心是教导我们：通过最高的智慧（般若），看透世界万物（包括我们自己）都不是独立、永恒、实在的"东西"（这就是"空"），从而摆脱因为执着而产生的所有痛苦与痛苦与烦恼，获得内心的终极自由与平静（涅槃）。

---
**二、逐层分解理解**
**1. "照见五蕴皆空" —— 我们在执着什么？**
  - "五蕴"指的是 色、受、想、行、识 ，这是构成我们生命存在和精神活动的五个基本要素。

  - 色：指一切指一切物质形象，包括我们的身体。
  - 受：指感受（苦、乐、不苦不乐）。
  - 想：指概念、思维、取像。
  - 行：指意志、造作、行为的趋势。
  - 识：指了别、认识、判断的意识本身。
* "五蕴皆空"是什么意思？
  - 它不是否定你眼睛看到、耳朵听到的东西不存在（"顽空"或"虚无"），而是说，所有这些现象都没有独立、不变、可以自我主宰的"自性"。它们都是在各种因缘条件和合下，暂时存在、不断变化的。

  - 好比一辆汽车：它只是"车轮、引擎、方向盘……"这些零件的临时组合。离开了这些零件，"汽车"这个概念就不存在。我们说"汽车"，只是为了方便沟通而给这个组合体起的名字。它的本质是"空"的——没有一个叫"汽车"的灵魂实体。
  - 同理，我们的"我"：也只是肉体、感受、思想、习惯、意识的暂时组合。昨天你的想法和今天可能不同，身体细胞也在不断新陈代谢。并没有一个固定不变的"我"在被伤害、被赞美。 我们所执着的"我"，也像那辆汽车一样，是缘起的、暂时的，其本质是"空"。
  - 我们所有的痛苦（"一切苦厄"），根源就在于把这种因缘和合、刹那生灭的"五蕴"当成了真实的"我"和"我的"来紧紧抓住。

**2. "色不异空，空不异色" —— "空"到底是什么关系？**
  - 这是最著名也是最容易误解的一句。它精准地阐述了"现象"（色）与"本质"（空）的关系：
  - 色不异空：任何你看得到摸得着的现象（色），其本质就是空性（依赖条件而生，没有自性）。现象离不开空性。
  - 空不异色：空性并不是在现象之外另一个地方存在，它就体现在每一个具体的现象之中。空性也离不开现象。
  - 色即是空，空即是色：现象就是空性，空性就是现象。二者是一体两面，不能分割。
* 一个比喻：水与波
  - 大海（比喻空性）升起波浪（比喻色/现象）。
  - 波浪不就是海水吗？（色即是空）
  - 但你能在海面上找到一个不是波浪的、"纯粹"的海水吗？（空即是色）
  - 波浪有生有灭（起伏），但其本质（水）从未生灭。同样，万事万物（色）生生灭灭，但其空性从未改变。

**3. "是"是诸法空相" —— 空性的特质是什么？**
  - 既然万法的本质是"空"，那么这个"空"有什么特性呢？
  - 不生不灭：因为它不是一個具体"东西"，所以无所谓产生和消失。
  - 不垢不净：因为它超越对立，所以无所谓干净和肮脏。
  - 不增不减：因为它遍一切处，所以无所谓增加和减少。
  - 这描述的是一种绝对的、超越一切二元对立的真理境界。

**4. 一连串的"无" —— 破除所有执着点**
  - 经文后面用了一连串的"无"（无眼耳鼻舌身意……无苦集灭道…），这是在扫荡我们一切可能产生执着的观念和境界。从凡夫的感官（六根）、认知对象（六尘），到圣贤的修行果位（四谛、智、得），全部都用"无"来打破。
  - 这意味着：真正的解脱，是连"我在修行"、"我要得道"这种微细的执着也要放下。如果还觉得自己"得到了"什么，那依然是一种执着，依然是枷锁。

**5. "心无挂碍" —— 实践后的结果**
  - 当我们通过修行，真正在生命中证悟了上述"空"的智慧后，会怎么样？

  - 因为看清实相，不再执着（无所得），所以心里就没有了牵绊和绊和阻塞（无挂碍）。
  - 因为没有牵绊，所以不再害怕失去任何东西，内心也就没有了恐惧（无有恐怖）。
  - 最终就能远离所有错误的、颠倒的认知和幻想（比如认为有个永恒的"我"，认为事物是恒常不变的），达到彻底的觉悟和解脱（究竟涅槃）。

---
**三、《心经》对我们的现实意义（如何在生活中运用）**
  - 您不必是佛教徒，也可以从中汲取智慧，用于生活：

  - 看待挫折：当遇到失败或不快时，可以想一想"五蕴五蕴皆空"。让你痛苦的，往往不是你遭遇的事情本身，而是你对这件事的"想法"和"感受"（想蕴、蕴、受蕴）。看清这些念头和感受也是来来去去的、不是坚实的，你就你就更容易放下，不被情绪淹没。

  - 减少执着：对于特别在意的人或物，可以思惟"色即是空"。它们都是因缘和合的产物，关系会变，物品会坏。珍惜当下就好，不必强求永远拥有，这样可以减少很多控制和占有的痛苦。

  - 保持平和："心无挂碍"是一种极高的心境追求。在生活中，我们可以练习对于小事不那么斤斤计较，对于未来的不确定性不过度忧虑。事来时应对，事过时放手，让心灵保持更多的空间和自由。

  - 总结来说，理解《心经》就是学习一种"减法"的智慧——减去我们强加在世界和自己身上的那些固化的标签、永恒的期待和僵硬的定义，从而看到事物原本的、流动的、相互依存的状态。当我们这样去看待生活时，内心的负担自然会减轻，智慧和慈悲便会自然生起。
