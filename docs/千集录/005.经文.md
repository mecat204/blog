* **法会因由分第一**
  - 如是我闻：

  - 一时佛在舍卫国祈树给孤独园, 与大比丘众千二百五十人俱。尔时世尊, 食时着衣持钵, 入舍卫大城乞食。于其城中次第乞已, 还至本处, 饭食讫, 收衣钵, 洗足已, 敷座而坐。

* **Chapter 01**
  - This is what I heard.
  - At one time the Buddha was staying in the Jeta Grove, near the city of Sravasti.
  - With him there was a community of 1,250 venerable monks and devoted disciples.
  - One day before dawn, the Buddha clothed himself, and along with his disciples took up his alms bowl and entered the city to beg for food door to door, as was his custom.
  - After he had returned and eaten, he put away his bowl and cloak, bathed his feet, and then sat with his legs crossed and body upright upon the seat arranged for him.
  - He began mindfully fixing his attention in front of himself, while many monks approached the Buddha, and showing great reverence, seated themselves around him.

* **法会因由分第一·译文**
  - 这是我亲耳听佛陀所说的。

  - 那个时候, 佛陀居住在舍卫国的祇树给孤独园里, 与他在一起的一共有一千二百五十位德行高深的大比丘僧人。

  - 有一天, 到了该用斋饭的时候, 佛陀穿上僧衣, 拿着饭钵, 和弟子们一同走进舍卫城中去乞食。在城里, 他们挨家挨户地、不分贫富依次化缘。化到食物后, 就返回祇树给孤独园。吃完饭后, 佛陀收起僧衣和饭钵, 洗干净双脚, 然后铺好座位, 盘腿端身正坐。

  - 这时, 许多弟子都来到佛陀身边, 恭敬地向佛陀行礼后, 围坐在他的四周。

* **善现启请分第二**
  - 时长老须菩提, 在大众中, 即从座起, 偏袒右肩, 右膝着地, 合掌恭敬而白佛言："希有, 世尊, 如来善护念诸菩萨, 善付嘱诸菩萨。世尊, 善男子、善女人发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提心, 云何应住？云何降伏其心？"

  - 佛言："善哉, 善哉, 须菩提, 如汝所说, 如来善护念诸菩萨, 善付嘱诸菩萨。汝今谛听, 当为汝说。善男子、善女人, 发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提心, 应如是住, 如是降伏其心。"

  - "唯然, 世尊, 愿乐欲闻。"

* **Chapter 02**
  - After a time a most venerable monk named Subhuti, who was sitting in the congregation, rose from his seat.
  - He uncovered his right shoulder, placed his right knee on the ground, and as he joined his palms together he respectfully bowed and then addressed the Buddha:
  - "Most Honored One, It is truly majestic how much knowledge and wisdom your monks and disciples have been given through your most inspired teachings! It is remarkable that you look after our welfare so selflessly and so completely."
  - "Most Honored One, I have a question to ask you. If sons and daughters of good families want to develop the highest, most fulfilled and awakened mind, if they wish to attain the Highest Perfect Wisdom, what should they do to help quiet their drifting minds and help subdue their craving thoughts?"
  - The Buddha then replied:
  - "So it is as you say, Subhuti. Monks and disciples have been favored with the highest favor by the Buddha, the monks and disciples have been instructed with the highest instruction by the Buddha. The Buddha is constantly mindful of the welfare of his followers. Listen carefully with your full attention, and I will speak to your question."
  - "If sons and daughters of good families want to develop the highest, most fulfilled and awakened mind, if they wish to attain the Highest Perfect Wisdom and quiet their drifting minds while subduing their craving thoughts, then they should follow what I am about to say to you. Those who follow what I am about to say here will be able to subdue their discriminative thoughts and craving desires. It is possible to attain perfect tranquility and clarity of mind by absorbing and dwelling on the teachings I am about to give."
  - Then the Buddha addressed the assembly.

* **善现启请分第二·译文**
  - 这时, 人群中一位名叫须菩提的长老, 从座位上站起身来。他整理了一下衣衫, 袒露右肩, 右膝跪地, 双手合十, 恭恭敬敬向佛陀行礼问道：

  - "世尊, 您以无上智慧的教化启迪众生, 让诸位比丘和信徒们都蒙受殊胜法益, 这实在是难得！您如此无私周全地护念一切众生, 更是令人感佩。"

  - "世尊, 弟子有个疑问：若有善男子、善女人发愿追求无上正等正觉之心, 希望证得至高无上的圆满智慧, 他们应当如何降伏心中纷扰的妄念, 平息贪著执取的念头？"

  - 佛陀嘉许地回答：

  - "问得好啊, 须菩提！正如你所说, 如来确实以最殊胜的法义滋养诸弟子, 以无上的智慧教导诸弟子。如来时刻不忘护念所有修行者。现在请你专心谛听, 我将为你解答这个问题。"

  - "若有善男子、善女人发愿追求无上正等正觉之心, 希望证得至高无上的圆满智慧, 想要止息妄念、降伏执著, 就当遵循我接下来要说的道理。依此修行者, 必能消除分别妄想与贪欲执著。通过信受奉行我将宣说的妙法, 必定能证得清净安宁的觉悟境界。"

  - 于是佛陀面向与会大众, 开始宣说妙法。

* **大乘正宗分第三**
  - 佛告须菩提："诸菩萨摩诃萨, 应如是降伏其心：若有一切众生之类, 若卵生, 若胎生, 若湿生, 若化生, 若有色, 若无色, 若有想, 若无想, 若非有想非无想, 我皆令入无余涅槃而灭度之。如是灭度无量无数无边众生, 实无众生得灭度者。何以故？须菩提, 若菩萨有我相、人相、众生相、寿者相, 即非菩萨。"

* **Chapter 03**
  - "All living beings, whether born from eggs, from the womb, from moisture, or spontaneously;  whether they have form or do not have form;  whether they are aware or unaware, whether they are not aware or not unaware, all living beings will eventually be led by me to the final Nirvana, the final ending of the cycle of birth and death. And when this unfathomable, infinite number of living beings have all been liberated, in truth not even a single being has actually been liberated."
  - "Why Subhuti? Because if a disciple still clings to the arbitrary illusions of form or phenomena such as an ego, a personality, a self, a separate person, or a universal self existing eternally, then that person is not an authentic disciple."

* **大乘正宗分第三·译文**
  - 佛陀继续说道：

  - "一切众生, 无论是卵生、胎生、湿生还是化生；无论是有形有相, 还是无形无相；无论是有意识思维, 或是无意识思维, 乃至非有想非无想的众生, 我都将引导他们进入究竟涅槃, 永断生死轮回。当这无量无数无边的众生都得到度化之时, 实际上并没有一个众生真正被度化。"

  - "知道为什么吗？须菩提。因为如果修行者还执着于'我'、'人'、'众生'、'寿者'这些相对的幻象——比如认为有真实的自我、独立的个体、恒常不变的主体, 或者执着于任何形相概念, 那么这样的人就不能称为真正的修行者。"

---
* **妙行无住分第四**
  - "复次, 须菩提, 菩萨于法应无所住, 行于布施。所谓不住色布施, 不住声、香、味、触、法布施。须菩提, 菩萨应如是布施, 不住于相。何以故？若菩萨不住相布施, 其福德不可思量。须菩提, 于意云何？东方虚空可思量不？"

  - "不也, 世尊。"

  - "须菩提, 南西北方, 四维上下虚空可思量不？"

  - "不也, 世尊。"

  - "须菩提, 菩萨无住相布施, 福德亦复如是不可思量。须菩提, 菩萨应如所教住。"

* **Chapter 04**
  - "Furthermore, Subhuti, in the practice of compassion and charity a disciple should be detached. That is to say, he should practice compassion and charity without regard to appearances, without regard to form, without regard to sound, smell, taste, touch, or any quality of any kind. Subhuti, this is how the disciple should practice compassion and charity. Why? Because practicing compassion and charity without attachment is the way to reaching the Highest Perfect Wisdom, it is the way to becoming a living Buddha."

  - "Subhuti, do you think that you can measure all of the space in the Eastern Heavens?"

  - "No, Most Honored One. One cannot possibly measure all of the space in the Eastern Heavens."

  - "Subhuti, can space in all the Western, Southern, and Northern Heavens, both above and below, be measured?"

  - "No, Most Honored One. One cannot possibly measure all the space in the Western, Southern, and Northern Heavens."

  - "Well, Subhuti, the same is true of the merit of the disciple who practices compassion and charity without any attachment to appearances, without cherishing any idea of form. It is impossible to measure the merit they will accrue. Subhuti, my disciples should let their minds absorb and dwell in the teachings I have just given."

* **妙行无住分第四·译文**
  - 佛陀又说："须菩提, 菩萨在修行布施时, 不应执着于任何表象。也就是说, 应当不住于色声香味触法等一切现象而行布施。须菩提, 菩萨应当这样修行无住相布施。为什么呢？因为无住相布施的功德, 如同虚空般不可衡量, 这样才能契入无上正等正觉。"

  - 佛陀问道："须菩提, 你认为东方虚空的广阔能够度量吗？"
  - 须菩提回答："世尊, 不能。东方虚空无边无际, 不可度量。"

  - 佛陀又问："那么四方上下的一切虚空, 可以度量吗？"
  - 须菩提答道："世尊, 十方虚空皆不可量。"

  - 佛陀开示道："正是如此, 须菩提。菩萨若能不执着于任何形相而行布施, 其所获功德也像这样不可计量。须菩提, 诸位弟子应当将我所说的教诲牢记于心, 如实修持。"

---
* **如理实见分第五**
  - "须菩提, 于意云何？可以身相见如来不？"

  - "不也, 世尊。不可以身相得见如来。何以故？如来所说身相, 即非身相。"

  - 佛告须菩提："凡所有相, 皆是虚妄。若见诸相非相, 即见如来。"


* **Chapter 05**
  - "Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Buddha be recognized by means of his bodily form?"

  - "No, Most Honored One, the Buddha cannot be recognized by means of his bodily form. Why? Because when the Buddha speaks of bodily form, it is not a real form, but only an illusion."

  - The Buddha then spoke to Subhuti: "All that has a form is illusive and unreal. When you see that all forms are illusive and unreal, then you will begin to perceive your true Buddha nature."

* **如理实见分第五·译文**
  * 佛祖问道："须菩提, 你怎么看？可以通过三十二相、八十种好这些身体特征来认出发掘如来吗？"

  * 须菩提回答："不可以, 世尊。不可以凭借身形相貌来见如来。为什么呢？因为如来所说的身相庄严, 并非真实永恒的存在, 只是因缘和合的假相。"

  * 佛陀于是告诉须菩提："一切有形有相的事物, 都是虚幻不实的。若能透彻领悟所有现象的虚妄性, 就在这个当下见证如来了来了。"

---
* **正信希有分第六**
  - 须菩提白佛言："世尊, 颇有众生, 得闻如是言说章句, 生实信不？"

  - 佛告须菩提："莫作是说。如来灭后, 后五百岁, 有持戒修福者, 于此章句能生信心, 以此为实。当知是人, 不于一佛、二佛、三四五佛而种善根, 已于无量千万佛所种诸善根。闻是章句, 乃至一念生净信者, 须菩提, 如来悉知悉见, 是诸众生得如是无量福德。何以故？是诸众生, 无复我相、人相、众生相、寿者相, 无法相, 亦无非法相。何以故？是诸众生, 若心取相, 即为著我、人、众生、寿者；若取法相, 即著我、人、众生、寿者。何以故？若取非法相, 即著我、人、众生、寿者。是故, 不应取法, 不应取非法。以是义故, 如来常说：汝等比丘知我说法如筏喻者。法尚应舍, 何况非法。"

* **Chapter 06**
  - Subhuti respectfully asked the lord Buddha, "Most Honored One! In the future, if a person hears this teaching, even if it is only a phrase or sentence, is it possible for that person to have a true faith and knowledge of Enlightenment awaken in their mind?"

  - "Without a doubt, Subhuti. Even 500 years after the Enlightenment of this Buddha there will be some who are virtuous and wise, and while practicing compassion and charity, will believe in the words and phrases of this Sutra and will awaken their minds purely. After they come to hear these teachings, they will be inspired with belief. This is because when some people hear these words, they will have understood intuitively that these words are the truth."

  - "But you must also remember, Subhuti, that such persons have long ago planted the seeds of goodness and merit that lead to this realization. They have planted the seeds of good deeds and charity not simply before one Buddhist temple, or two temples, or five, but before hundreds of thousands of Buddhas and temples. So when a person who hears the words and phrases of this Sutra is ready for it to happen, a pure faith and clarity can awaken within their minds."

  - "Subhuti, any person who awakens faith upon hearing the words or phrases of this Sutra will accumulate countless blessings and merit."

  - "How do I know this? Because this person must have discarded all arbitrary notions of the existence of a personal self, of other people, or of a universal self. Otherwise their minds would still grasp after such relative conceptions. Furthermore, these people must have already discarded all arbitrary notions of the non-existence of a personal self, other people, or a universal self. Otherwise, their minds would still be grasping at such notions. Therefore anyone who seeks total Enlightenment should discard not only all conceptions of their own selfhood, of other selves, or of a universal self, but they should also discard all notions of the non-existence of such concepts."

  - "When the Buddha explains these things using such concepts and ideas, people should remember the unreality of all such concepts and ideas. They should recall that in teaching spiritual truths the Buddha always uses these concepts and ideas in the way that a raft is used to cross a river. Once the river has been crossed over, the raft is of no more use, and should be discarded. These arbitrary concepts and ideas about spiritual things need to be explained to us as we seek to attain Enlightenment. However, ultimately these arbitrary conceptions can be discarded. Think Subhuti, isn't it even more obvious that we should also give up our conceptions of non-existent things?"

* **正信希有分第六·译文**
  - 须菩提恭敬地向佛陀请教："世尊！倘若后世有人听闻这样的佛法, 哪怕只是一个章节、一句话, 是否可能在此人心中生出真实的信心, 开启觉悟的智慧呢？"

  - 佛陀肯定地回答："毋庸置疑, 须菩提。即便在我灭度五百年后, 仍会有具足德行与智慧的人, 他们在践行慈悲布施时, 若对此经文的字句产生净信, 便能以纯净心开启觉悟。这些人听闻如是教法后, 必将生起坚定的信念。因为他们直觉地领会到, 这些言语即是终极真理。"

  - "但须菩提, 你要你要明白, 这样的人早在久远劫前就已种下通向觉悟的善根福德。他们所播种的善行与布施, 并非供养过一尊佛、两尊佛乃至五尊佛, 而是在千百亿佛前皆曾广植善缘。因此, 当有人听到这部经典的教诲而心有所应时, 纯净的信心与澄明的智慧自然会在其心中显现。"

  - "须菩提, 凡是因听闻此经文章句而生起信念的人, 所积累的福德的功德将浩瀚不可称量。"

  - "何以见得？因为此人必须已然舍弃'我相、人相、众生相、寿者相'的执着。若是心存'我能证果'、'他人可度'之类的分别念, 便仍被困于相对概念的牢笼。更重要的是, 他们还要超越'无我相、无人相'等否定概念的束缚——若执着于'无相'的概念, 同样落入了新的窠臼。所以说, 追求无上正等正觉的人, 不仅要放下对自我、他人和宇宙实体的执着, 连'不存在这些概念'的想法也应一并放下。"

  - "当如来用各种名相概念阐释真理时, 修行人要明白所有这些教法都如指月之指, 并非真相本身。应当记住, 佛陀演说佛法就像用竹筏渡河, 到达彼岸后, 筏子便该舍弃。这些为了引导我们开悟而设立的暂时概念, 最终都需要超越。想想吧须菩提, 既然实相概念都要放下, 那些建立在虚无之上的观念, 难道不更应该舍弃吗？"

---
* **无得无说分第七**
  - "须菩提, 于意云何？如来得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提耶？如来有所说法耶？"

  - 须菩提言："如我解佛所说义, 无有定法名阿耨多罗三藐三菩提, 亦无有定法如来可说。何以故？如来所说法, 皆不可取、不可说, 非法、非非法。所以者何？一切圣贤皆以无为法而有差别。"

* **Chapter 07**
  - Then Buddha asked Subhuti, "What do you think, Subhuti, has the Buddha arrived at the highest, most fulfilled, most awakened and enlightened mind? Does the Buddha teach any teaching?"

  - Subhuti replied, "As far as I have understood the lord Buddha's teachings, there is no independently existing object of mind called the highest, most fulfilled, awakened or enlightened mind. Nor is there any independently existing teaching that the Buddha teaches. Why? Because the teachings that the Buddha has realized and spoken of cannot be conceived of as separate, independent things and therefore cannot be described. The truth in them is uncontainable and inexpressible. It neither is, nor is it not. What does this mean? What this means is that Buddhas and disciples are not enlightened by a set method of teachings, but by an internally intuitive process which is spontaneous and is part of their own inner nature."

* **无得无说分第七·译文**
  - 佛陀接着问须菩提："你是怎么理解的？须菩提, 如来是否证得了无上正等正觉？如来是否传授了具体的教法？"

  - 须菩提回答："据我所领会的佛陀教义来看, 并不存在一个独立存在的实体可以被称为'无上正等正觉'。同样, 也没有独立存在的教法可以说由佛陀传授。为什么呢？因为如来所证悟并演说的真理, 不能被割裂为独立的个体来理解, 所以也无法用语言完全描述。其中的真谛是超越语言文字的。它既不是确定的'存在', 也不是绝对的'不存在'。这是什么意思呢？意思是诸佛与弟子们的开悟, 并非依靠某种固定的教法体系, 而是通过内心本具的、自然而发的直观觉性。"

---
* **依法出生分第八**
  - "须菩提, 于意云何？若人满三千大千世界七宝, 以用布施, 是人所得福德宁为多不？"

  - 须菩提言："甚多, 世尊。何以故？是福德, 即非福德性, 是故如来说福德多。"

  - "若复有人于此经中受持, 乃至四句偈等, 为他人说, 其福胜彼。何以故？须菩提, 一切诸佛及诸佛阿耨多罗三藐三菩提法, 皆从此经出。须菩提, 所谓佛法者, 即非佛法。"

* **Chapter 08**
  - "Let me ask you Subhuti? If a person filled over ten thousand galaxies with the seven treasures for the purpose of compassion, charity, and giving alms, would this person not gain great merit and spread much happiness?"

  - "Yes, Most Honored One. This person would gain great merit and spread much happiness, even though, in truth, this person does not have a separate existence to which merit could accrue. Why? Because this person's merit is characterized with the quality of not being merit."

  - The Buddha continued, "Then suppose another person understood only four lines of this Sutra, but nevertheless took it upon themselves to explain these lines to someone else. This person's merit would be even greater than the other person's. Why? Because all Buddhas and all the teachings and values of the highest, most fulfilled, most awakened minds arise from the teachings in this Sutra. And yet, even as I speak, Subhuti, I must take back my words as soon as they are uttered, for there are no Buddhas and there are no teachings."

* **依法出生分第八·译文**
  - 佛陀问道："须菩提, 若有人以怜悯之心, 将遍满十万大千世界的金、银、琉璃等七宝用来布施济众, 此人所得的福德难道不多吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："世尊, 此人所得福德确实不可思议。然而真正通达佛法的行者, 明了福德本质也是缘起性空, 不会执着于'我在积累功德'的念头。为什么呢？因为真正的福德并无'福德'的实在自性可言。"

  - 佛陀接着说："假如另有人仅仅领悟了这本经典中的四句偈语, 却能发心为他人解说, 这人所得的福德更要胜过前者。为何如此？因为十方三世一切诸佛及其无上正等正觉之法, 皆从此经中生发。可是须菩提, 正当我说这话时, 立刻就要收回这句话——因为实质上既没有所谓的'佛', 也没有所谓的'法'。"

---
* **一相无相分第九**
  - "须菩提, 于意云何？须陀洹能作是念：我得须陀洹果不？"

  - 须菩提言："不也, 世尊。何以故？须陀洹名为入流, 而无所入。不入色、声、香、味、触、法, 是名须陀洹。"

  - "须菩提, 于意云何？斯陀含能作是念：我得斯陀含果不？"

  - 须菩提言："不也, 世尊。何以故？斯陀含名一往来, 而实无往来, 是名斯陀含。"

  - "须菩提, 于意云何？阿那含能作是念：我得阿那含果不？"

  - 须菩提言："不也, 世尊。何以故？阿那含名为不来, 而实无不来, 是故名阿那含。"

  - "须菩提, 于意云何？阿罗汉能作是念：我得阿罗汉道不？"

  - 须菩提言："不也, 世尊。何以故？实无有法名阿罗汉。世尊, 若阿罗汉作是念：我得阿罗汉道, 即为著我、人、众生、寿者。世尊, 佛说我得无诤三昧, 人中最为第一, 是第一离欲阿罗汉。世尊, 我不作是念：我是离欲阿罗汉。世尊, 我若作是念：我得阿罗汉道, 世尊则不说须菩提是乐阿兰那行者。以须菩提实无所行, 而名须菩提, 是乐阿兰那行。"

* **Chapter 09**
  - Buddha then asked, "What do you think, Subhuti, does one who has entered the stream which flows to Enlightenment, say 'I have entered the stream'?"

  - "No, Buddha", Subhuti replied. "A true disciple entering the stream would not think of themselves as a separate person that could be entering anything. Only that disciple who does not differentiate themselves from others, who has no regard for name, shape, sound, odor, taste, touch or for any quality can truly be called a disciple who has entered the stream."

  - Buddha continued, "Does a disciple who is subject to only one more rebirth say to himself, 'I am entitled to the honors and rewards of a Once-to-be-reborn.'?"

  - "No, Lord. 'Once-to-be-reborn' is only a name. There is no passing away, or coming into, existence. Only one who realizes this can really be called a disciple."

  - "Subhuti, does a venerable One who will never more be reborn as a mortal say to himself, 'I am entitled to the honor and rewards of a Non-returner.'?"

  - "No, Perfectly Enlightened One. A 'Non-returner' is merely a name. There is actually no one returning and no one not-returning."

  - "Tell me, Subhuti. Does a Buddha say to himself, 'I have obtained Perfect Enlightenment.'?"

  - "No, lord. There is no such thing as Perfect Enlightenment to obtain. If a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha were to say to himself, 'I am enlightened' he would be admitting there is an individual person, a separate self and personality, and would therefore not be a Perfectly Enlightened Buddha."

  - Subhuti then said, "Most Honored One! You have said that I, Subhuti, excel amongst thy disciples in knowing the bliss of Enlightenment, in being perfectly content in seclusion, and in being free from all passions. Yet I do not say to myself that I am so, for if I ever thought of myself as such then it would not be true that I escaped ego delusion. I know that in truth there is no Subhuti and therefore Subhuti abides nowhere, that he neither knows nor does he not know bliss, and that he is neither free from nor enslaved by his passions."

* **一相无相分第九·译文**
  - 佛陀接着问："须菩提, 你怎么想？一位证入圣道之流、走向觉悟的行者, 会心生'我已入圣流'的念头吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："不会的, 世尊。真正的入流者不会有'我正在进入什么境界'的分别心。只有当修行者泯除人我差别, 不再执着于名相、声音、香气、味道、触感和种种现象, 才能称为真正的入流者。"

  - 佛陀继续问："那位只需经历一次轮回就能成就佛果的修行者, 会认为自己'堪受一生补处的殊荣'吗？"

  - 须菩提答："世尊, 所谓'一生补处'也只是假名。名。实际上并无真实的来去生灭, 唯有洞彻这点的人才配称为圣者。"

  - "须菩提, 那位不再受生于尘世的阿罗汉, 会自称'我应得不来果位的荣耀'吗？"

  - "无上正等正觉的世尊, '不来者'不过是个名称。实则无来者亦无不来者。"

  - 佛陀追问："告诉我, 须菩提, 佛陀会暗自思忖'我已证得无上正等正觉'吗？"

  - 须菩提肃然应答："世尊, 并无实有的'无上正等正觉'可得。倘若圆满觉悟的佛陀动念'我已觉悟', 便是落入了人我分别的妄见, 那就不成其为圆满觉者了。"

  - 须菩提继而说道："至尊的佛陀！您曾说我在众多弟子中最能安住于解脱之乐, 乐, 怡然独处, 远离烦恼。但我从不自以为如此, 因为若存此念, 便是尚未破除我执。我深知本质上并无实在的须菩提, 因此须菩提不滞留在任何境相中, 既不知晓亦非不知晓安乐, 既未脱离也未受制于烦恼。"

---
* **庄严净土分第十**
  - 佛告须菩提："于意云何？如来昔在然灯佛所, 于法有所得不？"

  - "不也, 世尊。如来在然灯佛所, 于法实无所得。"

  - "须菩提, 于意云何？菩萨庄严佛土不？"

  - "不也, 世尊。何以故？庄严佛土者, 即非庄严, 是名庄严。"

  - "是故, 须菩提, 诸菩萨摩诃萨, 应如是生清净心, 不应住色生心, 不应住声、香、味、触、法生心, 应无所住而生其心。须菩提, 譬如有人, 身如须弥山王, 于意云何？是身为大不？"

  - 须菩提言："甚大, 世尊。何以故？佛说非身, 是名大身。"

* **Chapter 10**
  - The Buddha then continued, "What do you think, Subhuti? When I was in a previous life, with Dipankara Buddha, did I receive any definite teaching or attain any degree of self-control, whereby I later became a Buddha?"

  - "No, honorable one. When you were a disciple of Dipankara Buddha, in truth, you received no definite teaching, nor did you attain any definite degree of self-control."

  - "Subhuti, know also that if any Buddha would say, 'I will create a paradise,' he would speak falsely. Why? Because a paradise cannot be created nor can it not be uncreated."

  - "A disciple should develop a mind which is in no way dependent upon sights, sounds, smells, tastes, sensory sensations or any mental conceptions. A disciple should develop a mind which does not rely on anything."

  - "Therefore, Subhuti, the minds of all disciples should be purified of all thoughts that relate to seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, and discriminating. They should use their minds spontaneously and naturally, without being constrained by preconceived notions arising from the senses."

  - "Suppose, Subhuti, a man had an enormous body. Would the sense of personal existence he had also be enormous?"

  - "Yes, indeed, Buddha," Subhuti answered. "His sense of personal existence would be enormous. But the Buddha has taught that personal existence is just a name, for it is in fact neither existence nor non-existence. So it only has the name 'personal existence'."

* **庄严净土分第十·译文**
  - 佛陀继续垂询："须菩提, 你作何想？往昔我侍奉燃灯古佛时, 可曾获得某种确切的教法, 或达到某种特定的修行境界, 从而得以成佛的吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："世尊, 您当年在燃灯佛座下修行时, 实则未曾获得任何确定不变的教法, 也未曾证得任何固定不变的境界。"

  - "须菩提, 你也当知晓, 若有佛陀宣称'我将创造净土', 即是妄语。为何？因为净土既非被创造之物, 亦非本然存在之实体——它超越了'创造'与'非创造'的二元对立。"

  - "修行者应当培养不依附于色、声、香、味、触、法这六尘的心境。真正解脱的心灵, 如同虚空般无所依托。"

  - "是故, 须菩提, 所有修行者的心念都应净化对见闻觉知等六尘的执着。他们应该让心灵如流水般自然运作, 不被感官引发的固有概念所束缚。"

  - 佛陀设喻："譬如有人拥有巍巍庄严的身相。他所执着的'自我'概念也会随之增长吗？"

  - 须菩提即刻回应："诚然如此, 世尊。但其我执愈盛, 离道愈远。不过佛陀早已开示：所谓'自我'仅是假名, 因其本质既非实存亦非虚无。故而仅以'自我存在'之名相称谓之。"

  - "须菩提, 我今实言告汝, 若有善男子、善女人, 以七宝满尔所恒河沙数三千大千世界, 以用布施, 得福多不？"

  - "Subhuti, if there were as many Ganges rivers as the number of grains of sand in the Ganges, would you say that the number of grains of sand in all those Ganges rivers would be very many?"

  - Subhuti answered, "Very many indeed, Most Honored One. If the number of Ganges rivers were that large, how much more so would be the number of grains of sand in all those Ganges rivers."

  - "Subhuti, I will declare a truth to you. If a good man or a good woman filled over ten thousand galaxies of worlds with the seven treasures for each grain of sand in all those Ganges rivers, and gave it all away for the purpose of compassion, charity and giving alms, would this man or woman not gain great merit and spread much happiness?"

  - Subhuti replied, "Very much so, Most Honored One."

  - "Subhuti, if after studying and observing even a single stanza of this Sutra, another person were to explain it to others, the happiness and merit that would result from this virtuous act would be far greater."

* **无为福胜分第十一·译文**
  - 佛陀又问："须菩提, 倘若恒河之沙的数量等同于所有恒河的数目, 你是否会说这些恒河中沙粒的总数多得不可计数？"

  - 须菩提回答："确实多不可计, 世尊。单是恒河的数量就已无穷无尽, 更何况所有恒河中的沙粒总数。"

  - 佛陀郑重宣告："须菩提, 现在我要向你开示一个真理。如果有善男子、善女子, 用遍满如上述沙数之三千大千世界的七宝来进行布施, 他所获得的福德难道不多吗？"

  - 须菩提当即回应："非常多, 世尊。"

  - 佛陀进而指出："但是须菩提, 如果有人能够信受奉受奉行这部经中的任意一个四句偈, 并为他人解说, 这桩善举善举所带来的福德将远远超过前者。"

  - "Furthermore, Subhuti, if any person in any place were to teach even four lines of this Sutra, the place where they taught it would become sacred ground and would be revered by all kinds of beings. How much more sacred would the place become if that person then studied and observed the whole Sutra! Subhuti, you should know that any person who does that would surely attain something rare and profound. Wherever this Sutra is honored and revered there is a sacred site enshrining the presence of the Buddha or one of the Buddha's most venerable disciples."

* **Chapter 13**

  - Subhuti said to the Buddha, "By what name shall we know this Sutra, so that it can be honored and studied?"

  - The lord Buddha replied, "This Sutra shall be known as

  - 'The Diamond that Cuts through Illusion'.

  - By this name it shall be revered and studied and observed. What does this name mean? It means that when the Buddha named it, he did not have in mind any definite or arbitrary conception, and so named it. This Sutra is hard and sharp, like a diamond that will cut away all arbitrary conceptions and bring one to the other shore of Enlightenment."

  - "What do you think, Subhuti? Has the Buddha taught any definite teaching in this Sutra?"

  - "No lord, the Buddha has not taught any definite teaching in this Sutra."

  - "What do you think, Subhuti? Are there many particles of dust in this vast universe?"

  - Subhuti replied: "Yes, many, Most Honored One!"

  - "Subhuti, when the Buddha speaks of particles of dust, it does not mean I am thinking of any definite or arbitrary thought, I am merely using these words as a figure of speech. They are not real, only illusion. It is just the same with the word universe;  these words do not assert any definite or arbitrary idea, I am only using the words as words."

  - "Subhuti, what do you think? Can the Buddha be perceived by means of his thirty  -two physical characteristics?"

  - "No, Most Honored One. The Buddha cannot be perceived by his thirty  -two physical characteristics. Why? Because the Buddha teaches that they are not real but are merely called the thirty  -two physical characteristics."

  - "Subhuti, if a good and faithful person, whether male or female, has, for the sake of compassion and charity, been sacrificing their life for generation upon generation, for as many generations as the grains of sands in 3,000 universes;  and another follower has been studying and observing even a single section of this Sutra and explains it to others, that person's blessings and merit would be far greater."

* **如法受持分第十三·译文**
  - 须菩提问佛陀："我们应当以什么名字来称呼这部经典, 以便后人恭敬受持？"

  - 佛陀告示："此经名为《金刚般若波罗蜜经》。以此名号, 众生当时刻崇奉、研习并依法修行。这个名字有何深意？意为佛陀命名之时, 心中并无任何固定不变的念想, 因而如此立名。此法门坚利如金刚宝石, 足以斩断一切虚妄分别, 引渡众生抵达觉悟彼岸。"

  - "须菩提, 你怎么认为？佛陀可曾在这部经中讲授任何固定不变的教法吗？"

  - "没有, 世尊。佛陀并未在此经中传授任何确定不变的教义。"

  - "须菩提, 你觉得这茫茫宇宙中的微尘数量多吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："确实极多, 世尊！"

  - "须菩提, 当我说微尘时, 并非执着实有的微尘概念, 只是借用名言作为方便表达。它们并非真实存在, 只是幻化之名。所谓'宇宙'也是如此——这些言辞并非在界定某种实体, 不过是假名施设。"

  - "须菩提, 你怎么看？能否通过三十二种殊胜容貌来认识如来？"

  - "不能, 世尊。不可凭三十二相见如来。为何？因为如来开示这些相状本非真实, 只不过称之为三十二相罢了。"

  - "须菩提, 若有善男子、善女子, 以悲悯之心累世舍身布施, 其次数堪比三千大千世界微尘总数；而另有修行者虽只受持此经片段却能为他人解说, 后者所获的福德远胜前者。"

  - 佛告须菩提："如是, 如是。若复有人得闻是经, 不惊, 不怖, 不畏, 当知是人甚为希有。何以故？须菩提, 如来说第一波罗蜜, 即非第一波罗蜜, 是名第一波罗蜜。"

* **Chapter 14**

  - At that time, after listening to this Sutra, Subhuti had understood its profound meaning and was moved to tears.

  - He said, "What a rare and precious thing it is that you should deliver such a deeply profound teaching. Since the day I attained the eyes of understanding, thanks to the guidance of the Buddha, I have never before heard teachings so deep and wonderful as these. Most Honored One, if someone hears this Sutra, and has pure and clear confidence in it they will have a profound insight into the truth. Having perceived that profound insight, that person will realize the rarest kind of virtue. Most Honored One, that insight into the truth is essentially not insight into the truth, but is what the Buddha calls insight into the truth."

  - "Most Honored One, having listened to this Sutra, I am able to receive and retain it with faith and understanding. This is not difficult for me, but in ages to come – in the last five hundred years, if there is a person who hears this Sutra, who receives and retains it with faith and understanding, then that person will be a rare one, a person of most remarkable achievement. Such a person will be able to awaken pure faith because they have ceased to cherish any arbitrary notions of their own selfhood, other selves, living beings, or a universal self. Why? Because if they continue to hold onto arbitrary conceptions as to their own selfhood, they will be holding onto something that is non  -existent. It is the same with all arbitrary conceptions of other selves, living beings, or a universal self. These are all expressions of non  -existent things. Buddhas are Buddhas because they have been able to discard all arbitrary conceptions of form and phenomena, they have transcended all perceptions, and have penetrated the illusion of all forms."

  - The Buddha replied:

  - "So it is, Subhuti. Most wonderfully blest will be those beings who, on hearing this Sutra, will not tremble, nor be frightened, or terrified in any way. And why? The Buddha has taught this Sutra as the highest perfection. And what the Buddha teaches as the highest perfection, that also the innumerable Blessed Buddhas do teach. Therefore is it called the 'highest perfection'."

  - "Subhuti, when I talk about the practice of transcendent patience, I do not hold onto any arbitrary conceptions about the phenomena of patience, I merely refer to it as the practice of transcendent patience. And why is that? Because when, thousands of lifetimes ago, the Prince of Kalinga severed the flesh from my limbs and my body I had no perception of a self, a being, a soul, or a universal self. If I had cherished any of these arbitrary notions at the time my limbs were being torn away, I would have fallen into anger and hatred."

  - "I also remember Subhuti that during my five hundred previous lives I had used life after life to practice patience and to look upon my life humbly, as though I were a saint called upon to suffer humility. Even then my mind was free of arbitrary conceptions of the phenomena of my self, a being, a soul, or a universal self."

  - "Therefore, Subhuti, disciples should leave behind all distinctions of phenomena and awaken the thought of the attainment of Supreme Enlightenment. A disciple should do this by not allowing their mind to depend upon ideas evoked by the world of the senses – by not allowing their mind to depend upon ideas stirred by sounds, odors, flavors, sensory touch, or any other qualities. The disciple's mind should be kept independent of any thoughts that might arise within it. If the disciple's mind depends upon anything in the sensory realm it will have no solid foundation in any reality. This is why Buddha teaches that the mind of a disciple should not accept the appearances of things as a basis when exercising charity. Subhuti, as disciples practice compassion and charity for the welfare of all living beings they should do it without relying on appearances, and without attachment. Just as the Buddha declares that form is not form, so he also declares that all living beings are, in fact, not living beings."

  - 此刻, 听闻如是经义的须菩提, 已然洞悉其中甚深奥义, 不由得悲欣交集、潸然泪下。

  - 他虔诚禀白："世尊！您所宣说的无上妙法实属罕有！自从我得慧眼以来, 承蒙佛陀指引, 从未听过如此深邃绝妙的教法。世尊, 倘若有众生得闻此经, 生起清净不疑的信心, 便能照见万法实相。若能证见此真实相, 此人即成就最殊胜稀有的功德。世尊, 这般真实洞见, 究其本质已非寻常认知范畴内的'洞见', 而这才是如来所称的真正洞见。"

  - "世尊, 今日亲闻此经, 我能以信心清净受持读诵。这对我倒不算难事, 但在未来浊世——尤其是您涅槃后的最后五百年, 若有众生听闻此经并能信解受持, 此人当为凤毛麟角之辈, 堪称载道之器。这样的人之所以能生起纯净信念, 正因他们已放下了对我相、人相、众生相、寿者相的执着。何以故？若他们还抱着这些虚妄分别, 便是在追逐本不存在的幻影。但凡所有基于名相的概念, 诸如自我、他人、众生、宇宙本体等等, 其实质皆为皆为非真实存在。诸佛之所以成佛, 正是因他们彻底摆脱了对一切形式和现象的执着, 超越所有感知局限, 照破一切有为法的虚妄本质。"

  - 佛陀印可说：

  - "诚然如是, 须菩提。那些闻此经义心无惊惧、毫不退转的众生, 将获得无上福祉。何以故？如来所说最高圆满之法, 实乃十方三世一切诸佛共同印证之道, 故称为'无上圆满'。"

  - "须菩提, 当我提及忍辱波罗密的修行时, 心中并不执着于任何关于忍耐现象的设定, 仅仅是假名之为忍辱修行。这又是为何？忆及千劫千劫前, 歌利王肢解我身时, 我那时已无我相、人相、众生相、寿者相。倘若当时心存这些分别念, 在被节节支解时便会生起嗔恨。"

  - "我还记得, 须菩提, 在过去五百世修行中, 我曾生生世世修习安忍, 谦卑处世犹如圣者甘忍屈辱。即便在那时, 我的心念也已远离对自我、众生、灵魂或宇宙本体的种种设定。"

  - "是故须菩提, 修行者应当超越一切现象界的分别, 发起求证无上菩提之心。要达到这种境界, 就必须让心识不依赖于感官世界引发的各种概念——不让心识受到声色香味触法等尘境的影响。弟子的心应当始终保持独立, 不随境转。若心念依附于任何感官对象, 便失去了安住在实相上的根基。因此佛陀教导：修行者在践行慈悲利生时, 不应以色尘等现象为依据, 更不可产生丝毫执着。正如佛陀所言'诸相非相', 同理, 一切众生本质上亦非众生。"

  - "Subhuti, if on the one hand, a son or daughter of a good family gives up his or her life in the morning as many times as there are grains of sand in the Ganges river as an act of generosity, and gives as many again in the afternoon and as many again in the evening, and continues doing so for countless ages;  and if, on the other hand, another person listens to this Sutra with complete confidence and without contention, that person's happiness will be far greater. But the happiness of one who writes this Sutra down, receives, recites, and explains it to others cannot even be compared it is so great."

  - "Subhuti, we can summarize by saying that the merit and virtue of this Sutra is inconceivable, incalculable and boundless. The Buddha has declared this teaching for the benefit of initiates on the path to Enlightenment;  he has declared it for the benefit of initiates on the path to Nirvana. If there is someone capable of receiving, practicing, reciting, and sharing this Sutra with others, the Buddha will see and know that person, and he or she will receive immeasurable, incalculable, and boundless merit and virtue. Such a person is known to be carrying the Supreme Enlightenment attained by the Buddha. Why? Subhuti, if a person is satisfied with lesser teachings than those I present here, if he or she is still caught up in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, or a universal self, then that person would not be able to listen to, receive, recite, or explain this Sutra to others."

  - "Subhuti, wherever this Sutra shall be observed, studied and explained, that place will become sacred ground to which countless spiritually advanced beings will bring offerings. Such places, however humble they may be, will be revered as though they were famous temples, and countless pilgrims will come there to worship. Such a place is a shrine and should be venerated with formal ceremonies, and offerings of flowers and incense. That is the power of this Sutra."

* **持经功德分第十五·译文**

  - "须菩提, 总而言之, 此经所蕴含的功德利益实乃不可思量、不可称计、无有边际。如来宣说此法, 是为利益趋向觉醒之路的发心者, 是为利益趋向涅槃之道的修行者。若有人能信受奉持、读诵演说此经, 如来悉知是人、悉见是人, 皆得成就无可估量的殊胜功德。这样的人, 可谓荷担如来无上正等正觉。何以故？须菩提, 若有人耽溺于小法浅见, 尚执着于我相、人相、众生相、寿者相之人, 则不可能听闻、受持、读诵此经, 更遑论为人解说。"

  - "须菩提, 凡是能够信奉、研读、讲说此经之处, 此地即成圣域, 无数具德天众皆来供养。纵是茅蓬柴扉, 亦如宝刹精舍, 万千信众自当虔心朝礼。这等所在即是佛塔道场, 应以香花璎珞庄严供养, 此乃般若法门之威神力。"

* **Chapter 16**
  - "Furthermore, Subhuti, if a good man or good woman who accepts, upholds, reads or recites this Sutra is disdained or slandered, if they are despised or insulted, it means that in prior lives they committed evil acts and as a result are now suffering the fruits of their actions. When their prior life's evil acts have finally been dissolved and extinguished, he or she will attain the supreme clarity of the most fulfilled, and awakened mind."

  - "Subhuti, in ancient times before I met Dipankara Buddha, I had made offerings to and had been attendant of all 84,000 million Buddhas. If someone is able to receive, recite, study, and practice this Sutra in a later, more distant age, then the happiness and merit brought about by this virtuous act would be hundreds of thousands of times greater than that which I brought about by my service to the Buddhas in ancient times. In fact, such happiness and merit cannot be conceived or compared with anything, even mathematically. If I were to explain all this in detail now some people might become suspicious and disbelieving, and their minds may even become disoriented or confused. Subhuti, you should know that the meaning of this Sutra is beyond conception and discussion. Likewise, the fruit resulting from receiving and practicing this Sutra is beyond conception and discussion."

* **能净业障分第十六·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示："再者, 须菩提, 若有善男子、善女子受持读诵此经, 却遭轻蔑诽谤, 受人冷眼侮辱, 这说明他们往昔造作的恶业正在承受相应的苦报。等到前世恶业的因果终于消尽, 他们必将在清净觉悟中获得无上正等正觉。"

  - "须菩提, 忆念往昔我值遇燃灯佛之前, 曾恭敬供养八万四千亿佛, 悉心承事无有遗漏。但若有人在后世末法时代, 能对此经受持读诵、如法修行, 那么这份善举带来的福泽, 将千万倍于我往昔供养诸佛的功德。事实上, 这般的福德根本无法用思议揣度, 乃至用数字比较也都不能及。倘若我现在详细阐述这些, 恐怕有人会心生狐疑, 甚至心智迷乱。须菩提, 你当明白此经义理超越一切思维推度和言语议论。同样, 依此经修行所得的果报, 也是不可思议、不可言说的。"

  - 佛言："如是如是。须菩提, 实无有法, 如来得发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。须菩提, 若有法, 如来得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提者, 然灯佛即不与我授记：'汝于来世当得作佛, 号释迦牟尼。'以实无有法得发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提, 是故然灯佛与我授记, 作是言：'汝于来世当得作佛, 号释迦牟尼。'何以故？如来者, 即诸法如义。若有人言：如来得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提, 须菩提, 实无有法, 佛得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提。"

  - "须菩提, 如来所得阿耨多罗三藐三菩提, 于是中无实无虚。是故如来说一切法皆是佛法。须菩提, 所言一切法者, 即非一切法, 是故名一切法。须菩提, 譬如人身长大……"

  - 须菩提言："世尊, 如来说人身长大, 即为非大身, 是名大身。"

  - "须菩提, 菩萨亦如是。若作是言, 我当灭度无量众生, 即不名菩萨。何以故？须菩提, 实无有法名为菩萨。是故, 佛说一切法无我、无人、无众生、无寿者。

  - "须菩提, 若菩萨作是言, 我当庄严佛土, 是不名菩萨。何以故？如来说庄严佛土者, 即非庄严, 是名庄严。须菩提, 若菩萨通达无我法者, 如来说名真是菩萨。"

* **Chapter 17**
  - At that time, the venerable Subhuti then asked the Buddha, "World  -Honored One, may I ask you a question again? If sons or daughters of a good family want to develop the highest, most fulfilled and awakened mind, if they wish to attain the Highest Perfect Wisdom, what should they do to help quiet their drifting minds and master their thinking?"

  - The Buddha replied:

  - "Subhuti, a good son or daughter who wants to give rise to the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind must create this resolved attitude of mind: 'I must help to lead all beings to the shore of awakening, but, after these beings have become liberated, in truth I know that not even a single being has been liberated.' Why is this so? If a disciple cherishes the idea of a self, a person, a living being or a universal self, then that person is not an authentic disciple. Why? Because in fact there is no independently existing object of mind called the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind."

  - "What do you think, Subhuti? In ancient times, when the Buddha was living with Dipankara Buddha, did he attain anything called the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind?"

  - "No, Most Honored One. According to what I understand from the teachings of the Buddha, there is no attaining of anything called the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind."

  - The Buddha said:

  - "You are correct, Subhuti. In fact, there does not exist any so  -called highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind that the Buddha attains. Because if there had been any such thing, Dipankara Buddha would not have predicted of me, 'In the future, you will come to be a Buddha known as The Most Honored One'. This prediction was made because there is, in fact, nothing to be attained. Someone would be mistaken to say that the Buddha has attained the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind because there is no such thing as a highest, most fulfilled, or awakened mind to be attained."

  - "Subhuti, a comparison can be made with the idea of a large human body. What would you understand me to mean if I spoke of a 'large human body'?"

  - "I would understand that the lord Buddha was speaking of a 'large human body' not as an arbitrary conception of its being, but as a series of words only. I would understand that the words carried merely an imaginary meaning. When the Buddha speaks of a large human body, he uses the words only as words."

  - "Subhuti, it is just the same when a disciple speaks of liberating numberless sentient beings. If they have in mind any arbitrary conception of sentient beings or of definite numbers, then they are unworthy of being called a disciple. Subhuti, my teachings reveal that even such a thing as is called a 'disciple' is non  -existent. Furthermore, there is really nothing for a disciple to liberate."

  - "A true disciple knows that there is no such thing as a self, a person, a living being, or a universal self. A true disciple knows that all things are devoid of selfhood, devoid of any separate individuality."

  - To make this teaching even more emphatic, the lord Buddha continued,

  - "If a disciple were to speak as follows, 'I have to create a serene and beautiful Buddha field', that person is not yet truly a disciple. Why? What the Buddha calls a 'serene and beautiful Buddha field' is not in fact a serene and beautiful Buddha field. And that is why it is called a serene and beautiful Buddha field. Subhuti, only a disciple who is wholly devoid of any conception of separate selfhood is worthy of being called a disciple."

* **究竟无我分第十七·译文**
  - 这时, 尊者须菩提再度请示佛陀："世尊, 善男子、善女子若发心求无上正等正觉, 应当如何安住飘忽不定的心念, 如何降服妄念思绪？"

  - 佛陀开示道：

  - "须菩提, 发心求无上正等正觉者, 应当生起这样的决心：'我誓愿度化一切众生达至觉悟彼岸, 但当众生皆得度化时, 须了知实无任一众生被度化。为何如此？若修行者心存'我相、人相、众生相、寿者相', 则非真正的菩萨。因为实际上并不存在一个独立存在的实体可称为'无上正等正觉之心'。"

  - "须菩提, 你以为如何？往昔我亲近燃灯古佛时, 可曾获得名为'无上正等正觉'的实法吗？"

  - "不曾, 世尊。依我对佛陀教法的理解, 本来就没有某个叫'无上正等正觉'的境界可得。因为若有实在的果位可得, 燃灯佛就不会为我授记：'汝于来世当得作佛, 号释迦牟尼'。此授记成立的前提, 恰恰是因为根本没有任何实在的果位可得。若有人说'佛陀证得了无上正等正觉', 这是一种谬误见解, 因为所谓的'无上正等正觉'本身就是假名施设。"

  - 佛陀又说：

  - "须菩提, 譬如有人说'伟岸人身'。你若听我这么说, 该如何理解？"

  - "我会明白世尊所说的'伟岸人身'并非指实有的躯体, 只是名言概念。我理解这些词语仅具有符号意义。"

  - "须菩提, 同样的道理, 若菩萨声称要度化无量众生, 但心中却执着'众生'与'数量'的概念, 那就不配称为菩萨。须菩提, 我的教法表明：就连'菩萨'这个概念本身也是空无自性的。而且, 实际上并没有什么众生需要被度化。"

  - "真正的修行者了知：根本没有实存的'我'、'人'、'众生'、'寿者'的独立实体。真正的修行者明白万法皆空, 无有独立自性。"

  - 为使教法更为明晰, 佛陀继续宣说：

  - "若菩萨这样说：'我要建设庄严佛土', 此人还未成为真正的菩萨。为何？因为如来所说的'庄严佛土', 本质上并非真实存在的清净国土, 所以才称之为庄严佛土。须菩提, 唯有全然舍弃'我执'分别的修行者, 才配称为菩萨。"

* **Chapter 18**
  - The Buddha then asked Subhuti, "What do you think? Does the Buddha have human eyes?"

  - "Subhuti replied, "Yes, he has human eyes."

  - "Does he have the eyes of Enlightenment?"

  - "Of course, the Buddha has the eyes of Enlightenment, otherwise he would not be the Buddha."

  - "Does the Buddha have the eyes of transcendent intelligence?"

  - "Yes, the Buddha has the eyes of transcendent intelligence."

  - "Does the Buddha have the eyes of spiritual intuition?"

  - "Yes, lord, the Buddha has the eyes of spiritual intuition."

  - "Does the Buddha have the eyes of love and compassion for all sentient beings?"

  - Subhuti agreed and said, "Lord, you love all sentient life."

  - "What do you think, Subhuti? When I referred to the grains of sand in the river Ganges, did I assert that they were truly grains of sand?"

  - "No blessed lord, you only spoke of them as grains of sand."

  - "Subhuti, if there were as many Ganges rivers as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges, and if there were as many buddhalands as there are grains of sand in all those innumerable rivers, would these buddhalands be considered numerous?"

  - "Very numerous indeed, lord Buddha."

  - "Subhuti, I know the mind of every sentient being in all the host of universes, regardless of any modes of thought, conceptions or tendencies. For all modes, conceptions and tendencies of thought are not mind. And yet they are called 'mind'. Why? It is impossible to retain a past thought, to seize a future thought, and even to hold onto a present thought."

* **一体同观分第十八·译文**
  - 佛陀又问须菩提："你以为如何？如来是否有肉眼？"

  - 须菩提答："是的, 如来有肉眼。"

  - "是否有慧眼？"

  - "当然, 如来有慧眼, 否则不成其为佛。"

  - "是否有法眼？"

  - "是的, 世尊, 如来具足法眼。"

  - "是否有佛眼？"

  - "世尊, 如来确有佛眼。"

  - "佛陀是否具备慈视一切有情的大悲之眼？"

  - 须菩提恭敬回应："世尊, 您以无缘大慈摄护众生。"

  - "须菩提, 你怎么想？当我说恒河中的沙粒时, 是否意指它们是真实的沙子？"

  - "不, 世尊, 您只是假借沙粒之名相而言说。"

  - "须菩提, 假使有像恒河沙数那样多的恒河, 又有像所有这些恒河沙数那样多的佛土, 这些佛土算得上多吗？"

  - "确实多得不可计量, 世尊。"

  - "须菩提, 我了知无量世界中一切众生的每一个心念, 不论何种思维模式、概念或倾向。然而所有的思维模式、概念和倾向都不是真心。它们只是被称作'心念'。为何如此？过去的念头不可追回, 未来的念头无从捕捉, 即便是当下的心念也难以把捉停留。"

  - The Buddha continued:

  - "What do you think Subhuti? If a follower were to give away enough treasures to fill 3,000 universes, would a great blessing and merit incur to him or her?"

  - Subhuti replied, "Honored one, such a follower would acquire considerable blessings and merit."

  - The lord Buddha said:

  - "Subhuti, if such a blessing had any substantiality, if it were anything other than a figure of speech, the Most Honored One would not have used the words 'blessings and merit'."

* **法界通化分第十九·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "须菩提, 你以为如何？若有修行者布施足以充满三千大千世界的珍宝, 此人是否能获得巨大的福报功德？"

  - 须菩提回答："世尊, 这样的修行者确实会获得极大的福报功德。"

  - 佛陀说道：

  - "须菩提, 如果这样的福报具有真实不变的本性, 如果它不是一种方便言说的譬喻, 如来就不会使用'福报功德'这样的言辞。"

* **Chapter 20**
  - "Subhuti, what do you think, should one look for Buddha in his perfect physical body?"

  - "No, Perfectly Enlightened One, one should not look for Buddha in his perfect physical body. Why? The Buddha has said that the perfect physical body is not the perfect physical body. Therefore it is called the perfect physical body."

  - "Subhuti, what do you think, should one look for Buddha in all his perfect appearances?"

  - "No Most Honored One, one should not look for Buddha in all his perfect appearances. Why? The Buddha has said perfect appearances are not perfect appearances. Therefore they are called perfect appearances."

* **离色离相分第二十·译文**
  - 佛陀问道："须菩提, 你怎么认为？人们是否应该通过完美庄严的身体形象来寻觅佛陀？"

  - 须菩提回答："无上正等正觉的世尊, 不应该依外貌觅如来。原因何在？因为如来曾经说过, 完美的形体并非真实的完美形体, 所以才称之为完美的形体。"

  - 佛陀又问："须菩提, 那你觉得, 世人是否应该凭借一切完满的相好来认识佛陀？"

  - 须菩提恭敬答道："不应如此, 世尊。不可以凭外在形相见如来。为何？如来所说的完满相好, 本质上并非真实的相好, 因此才称作完满相好。"

  - 尔时, 慧命须菩提白佛言："世尊, 颇有众生于未来世闻说是法, 生信心不？"

  - 佛言："须菩提, 彼非众生, 非不众生。何以故？须菩提, 众生众生者, 如来说非众生, 是名众生。"

* **Chapter 21**
  - "Subhuti, do not maintain that the Buddha has this thought: 'I have spoken spiritual truths.' Do not think that way. Why? If someone says the Buddha has spoken spiritual truths, he slanders the Buddha due to his inability to understand what the Buddha teaches. Subhuti, as to speaking truth, no truth can be spoken. Therefore it is called 'speaking truth'."

  - At that time Subhuti, the wise elder, addressed the Buddha, "Most Honored One, will there be living beings in the future who believe in this Sutra when they hear it?"

  - The Buddha said:

  - "The living beings to whom you refer are neither living beings nor not living beings. Why? Subhuti, all the different kinds of living beings the Buddha speaks of are not living beings. But they are referred to as living beings."

* **非说所说分第二十一·译文**
  - 佛陀询问："须菩提, 你怎么想？人们是否应该从完美庄严的色身形象中寻找佛陀？"

  - 须菩提回答："无上正等正觉的世尊, 不应从色身形相当中寻觅如来。原因何在？因为佛陀曾开示：所谓的完美色身并非实有的完美色身, 所以才给予'完美色身'这个名称。"

  - 佛陀继续追问："须菩提, 那你认为, 是否应该通过一切圆满无缺的相好来认识佛陀？"

  - 须菩提礼拜作答："世尊, 不可以凭借任何圆满相好來见如来。为何？如来所说的圆满相好, 本质上并非真实永恒的相好, 因此才称之为圆满相好。"

* **Chapter 22**
  - Subhuti again asked, "Blessed lord, when you attained complete Enlightenment, did you feel in your mind that nothing had been acquired?"

  - The Buddha replied:

  - "That is it exactly, Subhuti. When I attained total Enlightenment, I did not feel, as the mind feels, any arbitrary conception of spiritual truth, not even the slightest. Even the words 'total Enlightenment' are merely words, they are used merely as a figure of speech."

* **无法可得分第二十二·译文**
  - 须菩提再次请益：「世尊, 您证得无上正等正觉时, 心中是否觉得有所获得？」

  - 佛陀答道：

  - 「正是如此, 须菩提。我在成就无上菩提时, 心中没有丝毫'我已证得无上正等正觉'的念头。因为如果有这样的念头, 便是执着于'我相、人相、众生相、寿者相, 那就偏离了真正的觉悟。」

* **Chapter 23**
  - "Furthermore Subhuti, what I have attained in total Enlightenment is the same as what all others have attained. It is undifferentiated, regarded neither as a high state, nor a low state. It is wholly independent of any definite or arbitrary conceptions of an individual self, other selves, living beings, or a universal self."

  - "Subhuti, when someone is selflessly charitable, they should also practice being ethical by remembering that there is no distinction between one's self and the selfhood of others. Thus one practices charity by giving not only gifts, but through kindness and sympathy. Practice kindness and charity without attachment and you can become fully enlightened."

  - "Subhuti, what I just said about kindness does not mean that when someone is being charitable they should hold onto arbitrary conceptions about kindness, for kindness is, after all, only a word and charity needs to be spontaneous and selfless, done without regard for appearances."

* **净心行善分第二十三·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示："须菩提, 还有一点很重要：我所证得的无上正等正觉, 与其他一切诸佛所证平等无异。这其中没有高低之分, 因为它完全不依赖任何关于自我、他人、众生或宇宙本体的固定概念。"

  - "须菩提, 当一个人行无私布施时, 更应持守清净戒律, 但要明白自己的本性与他人的本性原本没有区别。所以不仅要以财物行布施, 更要以慈悲心行无畏施。怀着无执着的心修习慈悲与布施, 方能臻至圆满觉悟。"

  - "须菩提, 我刚才提到的慈悲, 并不意味着有人在行布施时应拘泥于某些特定概念。因为说到底, "慈悲"也不过是一个词语, 真正的布施应当是自然而然、无我无私的, 不为任何表面现象所牵绊。"

* **Chapter 24**
  - "Subhuti, if a person collected treasures as high as 3,000 of the highest mountains, and gave them all to others, their merit would be less than what would accrue to another person who simply observed and studied this Sutra and, out of kindness, explained it to others. The latter person would accumulate hundreds of times the merit, hundreds of thousands of millions of times the merit. There is no conceivable comparison."

* **福智无比分第二十四·译文**
  - 佛陀说："须菩提, 假使有人堆积珍宝高如三千世界里最高的山峦, 并将其全部施与他人, 此人所得的功德, 还不及另一位仅仅研习并心怀慈悲为他人解说此经的修行者。为什么？因为一切诸佛及其无上正等正觉之法, 皆由此经流出。须菩提, 所谓的佛法, 并不是实有的佛法, 所以才称之为佛法。"

  - "须菩提, 如来说有我者, 即非有我, 而凡夫之人以为有我。须菩提, 凡夫者, 如来说既非凡夫, 是名凡夫。"

* **Chapter 25**
  - "Subhuti, do not say that the Buddha has the idea, 'I will lead all sentient beings to Nirvana.' Do not think that way, Subhuti. Why? In truth there is not one single being for the Buddha to lead to Enlightenment. If the Buddha were to think there was, he would be caught in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, or a universal self. Subhuti, what the Buddha calls a self essentially has no self in the way that ordinary persons think there is a self. Subhuti, the Buddha does not regard anyone as an ordinary person. That is why he can speak of them as ordinary persons."

* **化无所化分第二十五·译文**
  - 佛陀告诫道："须菩提, 你不要认为佛陀有这样的念头：'我应当救度一切众生进入涅槃。'切莫这样想。为什么呢？因为根本上并没有一个独立的'众生'需要被度化。倘若佛陀执着于此念, 便陷入了'我相我相、人相、众生相、寿者相'的分别之中。须菩提, 如来所说的'我', 本质上不同于凡夫所执着的那个实有的'我'。正因为如来已经超越这些分别, 他才可以用'凡夫'这个名称来称呼众生。"

  - Then the Buddha inquired of Subhuti:

  - "What do you think Subhuti? Is it possible to recognize the Buddha by the 32 physical marks?"

  - Subhuti replied, "Yes, Most Honored One, the Buddha may thus be recognized."

  - "Subhuti, if that were true then Chakravartin, the mythological king who also had the 32 marks, would be called a Buddha."

  - Then Subhuti, realizing his error, said, "Most Honored One, now I realize that the Buddha cannot be recognized merely by his 32 physical marks of excellence."

  - The Buddha then said:

  - "Should anyone, looking at an image or likeness of the Buddha, claim to know the Buddha and worship him, that person would be mistaken, not knowing the true Buddha."

* **法身非相分第二十六·译文**
  - 佛陀问须菩提："你怎么看？能否通过三十二种显著的身体特征来辨认佛陀？"

  - 须菩提起初回答："是的, 世尊, 或许可以通过这些特征来认出佛陀。"

  - 佛陀立即点拨："须菩提, 若果真如此, 那么转轮圣王也具有这三十二相, 他也该被称为佛陀了。"

  - 须菩提闻言立即醒悟, 恭敬地说："世尊, 现在我明白了, 不能仅仅依靠身体上的三十二种殊胜相貌来认识如来。"

  - 佛陀遂开示道：

  - "如果有人看见佛像或佛陀的形象, 就以为认识了佛陀并加以崇拜, 这个人就走上了歧路, 因为他未能见到真正的佛陀。"

* **Chapter 27**
  - "However, Subhuti, if you think that the Buddha realizes the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind and does not need to have all the marks, you are mistaken. Subhuti, do not think in that way. Do not think that when one gives rise to the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind, one needs to see all objects of mind as nonexistent, cut off from life. Please do not think in that way. One who gives rise to the highest, most fulfilled, and awakened mind does not contend that all objects of mind are nonexistent and cut off from life. That is not what I say."

* **无断无灭分第二十七·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "但是须菩提, 如果你认为'如来证得了无上正等正觉, 所以不需要具备这些相好', 这也是错误的见解。须菩提, 千万不要这样想。切勿认为发起了无上菩提心就意味着要将一切心念对象视为断绝生命的不存在。请你不要这样理解。发无上菩提心的人, 绝不应当固执地认定一切事物都是虚无断灭的。这不是我说的真义。"

  - 须菩提白佛言："世尊, 云何菩萨不受福德？"

  - "须菩提, 菩萨所作福德, 不应贪著, 是故说不受福德。"

* **Chapter 28**
  - The lord Buddha continued:

  - "Subhuti, if someone gives treasures equal to the number of sands on the shores of the Ganges river, and if another, having realized the egolessness of all things, thereby understands selflessness, the latter would be more blessed than the one who practiced external charity. Why? Because great disciples do not see blessings and merit as a private possession, as something to be gained."

  - Subhuti inquired of the lord Buddha, "What do you mean 'great disciples do not see blessings and merit as a private possession'?"

  - The Buddha replied:

  - "Because those blessings and merit have never been sought after by those great disciples, they do not see them as private possessions, but they see them as the common possession of all beings."

* **不受不贪分第二十八·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "须菩提, 如果有人布施相当于恒河岸边所有沙粒数量的珍宝, 而另一个人通过认识到万物皆无自性, 从而理解了无我之理, 那么后者的福报将远超前者。何以故？因为真正的菩萨不见福德为私有, 不将功德视为可获取的资产。"

  - 菩提请教佛陀："您说'菩萨不见福德为私有'是何深意？"

  - 佛陀解答道：

  - "因为真正的修行者从来不刻意追求这些福德, 所以他们不将其视为私产, 反而把这些福报看作是一切众生共有的财富。"

* **威仪寂静分第二十九**
   - "须菩提, 若有人言：如来若来若去, 若坐若卧, 是人不解我所说义。何以故？如来者, 无所从来, 亦无所去, 故名如来。"

* **Chapter 29**
  - The Buddha said:

  - "Subhuti, if any person were to say that the Buddha is now coming or going, or sitting up or lying down, they would not have understood the principle I have been teaching. Why? Because while the expression 'Buddha' means 'he who has thus come, thus gone,' the true Buddha is never coming from anywhere or going anywhere. The name 'Buddha' is merely an expression, a figure of speech."

* **威仪寂静分第二十九·译文**
  - 佛陀开示：

  - "须菩提, 倘若有人认为：如来有来有去, 或坐或卧, 此等人未能领会我所说的真义。为什么呢？所谓如来, 既无所谓从哪里来, 也无所谓到哪里去, 所以才称为如来。"

* **一合理相分第三十**
  - "须菩提, 若善男子善女人, 以三千大千世界碎为微尘, 于意云何？是微尘众宁为多不？"

  - 须菩提言："甚多, 世尊。何以故？若是微尘众实有者, 佛即不说是微尘众。所以者何？佛说微尘众, 即非微尘众, 是名微尘众。世尊, 如来所说三千大千世界, 即非世界, 是名世界。何以故？若世界实有者, 即是一合相, 如来说一合相, 即非一合相, 是名一合相。"

  - "须菩提, 一合相者, 即是不可说。但凡夫之人, 贪着其事。"

* **Chapter 30**
  - The lord Buddha resumed:

  - "Subhuti, if any good person, either man or woman, were to take 3,000 galaxies and grind them into microscopic powder and blow it into space, what do you think, would this powder have any individual existence?"

  - Subhuti replied, "Yes, lord, as a microscopic powder blown into space, it might be said to have a relative existence, but as you use words, it has no existence. The words are used only as a figure of speech. Otherwise the words would imply a belief in the existence of matter as an independent and self  -existent thing, which it is not."

  - "Furthermore, when the Most Honored One refers to the '3,000 galaxies,' he could only do so as a figure of speech. Why? Because if the 3,000 galaxies really existed, their only reality would consist in their cosmic unity. Whether as microscopic powder or as galaxies, what does it matter? Only in the sense of the cosmic unity of ultimate being can the Buddha rightfully refer to it."

  - The lord Buddha was very pleased with this reply and said:

  - "Subhuti, although ordinary people have always grasped after an arbitrary conception of matter and galaxies, the concept has no true basis;  it is an illusion of the mortal mind. Even when it is referred to as 'cosmic unity' it is unthinkable and unknowable."

* **一合理相分第三十·译文**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "须菩提, 若有善男子、善女人, 将三千大千世界碎为微尘, 你认为这些微尘还具有独立的存在性吗？"

  - 须菩提回答："世尊, 这些微尘在相对层面上可以说存在, 但从您的教法来看, 这些都只是假名安立而已。语言文字只是权宜之说, 否则就会让人误以为物质是独立永恒的存在——而事实并非如此。"

  - "再者, 当您提到'三千大千世界'时, 这也只是一种比喻。为什么呢？因为如果三千大千世界真的存在, 它们的真实性也只存在于法性整体的层面。"

  - 佛陀对这个回答非常欣慰, 赞叹道：

  - "须菩提, 芸芸众生总是执着于物质和宇宙的实有概念, 但这些概念并无真实基础, 不过是凡夫心识的幻象。即使称之为'法性一体', 这个概念本身仍是不可思、不可知的。"

---
* **知见不生分第三十一**
  - "须菩提, 若人言, 佛说我见、人见、众生见、寿者见, 须菩提, 于意云何？是人解我所说义不？"

  - "不也, 世尊, 是人不解如来所说义。何以故？世尊说我见、人见、众生见、寿者见, 即非我见、人见、众生见、寿者见, 是名我见、人见众生见、寿者见。"

  - "须菩提, 发阿耨多罗三藐三菩提心者, 于一切法, 应如是知、如是见、如是信解, 不生法相。须菩提, 所言法相者, 如来说即非法相, 是名法相。"

* **Chapter 31**
  - The lord Buddha continued:

  - "If any person were to say that the Buddha, in his teachings, has constantly referred to himself, to other selves, to living beings, or to a universal self, what do you think, would that person have understood my meaning?"

  - Subhuti replied, "No, blessed lord. That person would not have understood the meaning of your teachings. For when you refer to those things, you are not referring to their actual existence, you only use the words as figures of speech, as symbols. Only in that sense can words be used, for conceptions, ideas, limited truths, and spiritual truths have no more reality than have matter or phenomena."

  - Then the lord Buddha made his meaning even more emphatic by saying:

  - "Subhuti, when people begin their practice of seeking to attaining total Enlightenment, they ought to see, to perceive, to know, to understand, and to realize that all things and all spiritual truths are no  -things, and, therefore, they ought not to conceive within their minds any arbitrary conceptions whatsoever."

* **知见不生分第三十一**
  - 佛陀继续开示：

  - "倘若有人说：佛陀在说法时, 常常提到自我、他人、众生或宇宙本体。你认为此人是否真正理解了我的教法真义？"

  - 须菩提回答："不, 世尊。此人尚未领会您教法的精髓。因为当您提及这些概念时, 并非确认其实存, 只是借用名言作为表法的工具。唯有如此看待语言, 才能得其真实效用, 因为一切概念、观念, 乃至世俗真理与神圣真理, 都比物质现象更加虚幻不实。"

  - 于是佛陀以更郑重的语气阐明真义：

  - "须菩提, 当修行者开始修证无上正等正觉时, 应当彻见、觉知、通达：一切事物与精神真理皆非实存, 因此他们不该在心中生起任何固定的概念分别。"

---
* **应化非真分第三十二**
  - "须菩提, 若有人以满无量阿僧祇世界七宝持用布施；若有善男子善女人发菩提心者, 持于此经, 乃至四句偈等, 受持读诵、为人演说, 其福胜彼。

  - "云何为人演说？不取于相, 如如不动。何以故？

  - "一切有为法,

  - 如梦幻泡影,

  - 如露亦如电,

  - 应作如是观。"

  - 佛说是经已, 长老须菩提及诸比丘、比丘尼、优婆塞、优婆夷, 一切世间天、人、阿修罗, 闻佛所说, 皆大欢喜, 信受奉行。

* **Chapter 32**
  - Buddha continued:

  - "Subhuti, if anyone gave to the Buddha an immeasurable quantity of the seven treasures sufficient to fill the whole universe;  and if another person, whether a man or woman, in seeking to attain complete Enlightenment were to earnestly and faithfully observe and study even a single section of this Sutra and explain it to others, the accumulated blessing and merit of that latter person would be far greater."

  - "Subhuti, how can one explain this Sutra to others without holding in mind any arbitrary conception of forms or phenomena or spiritual truths? It can only be done, Subhuti, by keeping the mind in perfect tranquility and free from any attachment to appearances."

  - "So I say to you –

  - This is how to contemplate our conditioned existence in this fleeting world:"

  - "Like a tiny drop of dew, or a bubble floating in a stream;

  - Like a flash of lightning in a summer cloud,

  - Or a flickering lamp, an illusion, a phantom, or a dream."

  - "So is all conditioned existence to be seen."

  - Thus spoke Buddha.

* **应化非真分第三十二·译文**
  - "须菩提, 假如有人以充满整个宇宙的无量七宝供养佛陀, 而另一人——无论是男是女——为了求得无上正等正觉, 能够以至诚心受持本经哪怕其中一个章节, 并为他人解说, 后者所积累的福德将远远超过前者。"

  - "须菩提, 如何才能不执着于形相、现象或真理概念而为他人解说此经呢？要做到这一点, 须菩提, 只有让心安住于绝对的宁静, 不受任何外相的束缚。"

  - "因此我告诉你们——

  - 应当这样观察我们所处的无常世界："

  - "如同草尖的露珠, 亦如溪流中的水泡；

  - 好似夏日云层的闪电,

  - 又如摇曳的烛火, 一切如同幻影、梦境。"

  - "一切因缘和合的现象都应作如是观。"

  - 佛陀如是宣说。

### 002. 心经
* **[心经 | 般若波罗蜜多心经](https://applenob.github.io/philosophy/heart_sutra/)**
* **原文**

  - 受、想、行、识, 亦复如是。
  - 舍利子, 是诸法空相, 不生不灭, 不垢不净, 不增不减。
  - 是故空中无色, 无受、想、行、识；
  - 无眼、耳、鼻、舌、身、意；

* **译文**
  - 观世音菩萨在深度修行智慧到彼岸的法门时, 透彻觉悟到身心世界的五种构成元素本质是空的, 从而解脱了一切苦难。

  - 舍利弗啊, 物质形态与空性没有区别, 空性与物质形态也没有区别；物质就是空, 空就是物质。感受、思想、行为、意识这四方面, 也都是同样的道理。

  - 舍利弗啊, 一切现象的本质都是空性的：没有生起与消亡, 没有污浊与清净, 不会增加也不会减少。

  - 因此在这空性之中：没有物质形态, 没有感受、思想、行为、意识；没有眼、耳、鼻、舌、身体、意念这些感官；没有形状颜色、声音气味、味道触感、概念法则这些认知对象；没有视觉感知的领域, 直至没有意识感知的领域；没有根本的无明烦恼, 也没有无明的终结；直到没有衰老死亡, 也没有衰老死亡的终结。没有痛苦的现象、痛苦的起因、痛苦的止息、灭苦的途径, 没有智慧也没有获得。

  - 正因为没有任何所得的缘故, 觉悟者们依靠这智慧到彼岸的法门, 内心清澈明朗毫无牵挂。因为没有牵挂障碍, 所以不会有恐惧担忧, 能够彻底摆脱错误认知和虚幻妄想, 达到完全解脱的境界。过去、现在、未来的所有觉者, 都是依靠这智慧到彼岸的法门, 获得了无上正等正觉的圆满智慧。

  - 由此可知, 智慧到彼岸的法门是具有伟大神力的密语, 是照耀光明的密语, 是最殊胜的密语, 是无可比拟的密语, 能够真实不虚地消除世间所有苦难。

  - 现在就说这智慧到彼岸的密语：（渡过去啊, 渡过去, 一起渡到彼岸去, 愿我们共同抵达觉悟的彼岸！）

### 003. 心经释义
**一、核心主旨（一句话概括）**
- 《心经》的核心是教导我们：通过最高的智慧（般若）, 看透世界万物（包括我们自己）都不是独立、永恒、实在的"东西"（这就是"空"）, 从而摆脱因为执着而产生的所有痛苦与痛苦与烦恼, 获得内心的终极自由与平静（涅槃）。

---
**二、逐层分解理解**
**1. "照见五蕴皆空" —— 我们在执着什么？**
  - "五蕴"指的是 色、受、想、行、识 , 这是构成我们生命存在和精神活动的五个基本要素。

  - 色：指一切指一切物质形象, 包括我们的身体。
  - 受：指感受（苦、乐、不苦不乐）。
  - 想：指概念、思维、取像。
  - 行：指意志、造作、行为的趋势。
  - 识：指了别、认识、判断的意识本身。
* "五蕴皆空"是什么意思？
  - 它不是否定你眼睛看到、耳朵听到的东西不存在（"顽空"或"虚无"）, 而是说, 所有这些现象都没有独立、不变、可以自我主宰的"自性"。它们都是在各种因缘条件和合下, 暂时存在、不断变化的。

  - 好比一辆汽车：它只是"车轮、引擎、方向盘……"这些零件的临时组合。离开了这些零件, "汽车"这个概念就不存在。我们说"汽车", 只是为了方便沟通而给这个组合体起的名字。它的本质是"空"的——没有一个叫"汽车"的灵魂实体。
  - 同理, 我们的"我"：也只是肉体、感受、思想、习惯、意识的暂时组合。昨天你的想法和今天可能不同, 身体细胞也在不断新陈代谢。并没有一个固定不变的"我"在被伤害、被赞美。 我们所执着的"我", 也像那辆汽车一样, 是缘起的、暂时的, 其本质是"空"。
  - 我们所有的痛苦（"一切苦厄"）, 根源就在于把这种因缘和合、刹那生灭的"五蕴"当成了真实的"我"和"我的"来紧紧抓住。

**2. "色不异空, 空不异色" —— "空"到底是什么关系？**
  - 这是最著名也是最容易误解的一句。它精准地阐述了"现象"（色）与"本质"（空）的关系：
  - 色不异空：任何你看得到摸得着的现象（色）, 其本质就是空性（依赖条件而生, 没有自性）。现象离不开空性。
  - 空不异色：空性并不是在现象之外另一个地方存在, 它就体现在每一个具体的现象之中。空性也离不开现象。
  - 色即是空, 空即是色：现象就是空性, 空性就是现象。二者是一体两面, 不能分割。
* 一个比喻：水与波
  - 大海（比喻空性）升起波浪（比喻色/现象）。
  - 波浪不就是海水吗？（色即是空）
  - 但你能在海面上找到一个不是波浪的、"纯粹"的海水吗？（空即是色）
  - 波浪有生有灭（起伏）, 但其本质（水）从未生灭。同样, 万事万物（色）生生灭灭, 但其空性从未改变。

**3. "是"是诸法空相" —— 空性的特质是什么？**
  - 既然万法的本质是"空", 那么这个"空"有什么特性呢？
  - 不生不灭：因为它不是一個具体"东西", 所以无所谓产生和消失。
  - 不垢不净：因为它超越对立, 所以无所谓干净和肮脏。
  - 不增不减：因为它遍一切处, 所以无所谓增加和减少。
  - 这描述的是一种绝对的、超越一切二元对立的真理境界。

**4. 一连串的"无" —— 破除所有执着点**
  - 经文后面用了一连串的"无"（无眼耳鼻舌身意……无苦集灭道…）, 这是在扫荡我们一切可能产生执着的观念和境界。从凡夫的感官（六根）、认知对象（六尘）, 到圣贤的修行果位（四谛、智、得）, 全部都用"无"来打破。
  - 这意味着：真正的解脱, 是连"我在修行"、"我要得道"这种微细的执着也要放下。如果还觉得自己"得到了"什么, 那依然是一种执着, 依然是枷锁。

**5. "心无挂碍" —— 实践后的结果**
  - 当我们通过修行, 真正在生命中证悟了上述"空"的智慧后, 会怎么样？

  - 因为看清实相, 不再执着（无所得）, 所以心里就没有了牵绊和绊和阻塞（无挂碍）。
  - 因为没有牵绊, 所以不再害怕失去任何东西, 内心也就没有了恐惧（无有恐怖）。
  - 最终就能远离所有错误的、颠倒的认知和幻想（比如认为有个永恒的"我", 认为事物是恒常不变的）, 达到彻底的觉悟和解脱（究竟涅槃）。

---
**三、《心经》对我们的现实意义（如何在生活中运用）**
  - 您不必是佛教徒, 也可以从中汲取智慧, 用于生活：

  - 看待挫折：当遇到失败或不快时, 可以想一想"五蕴五蕴皆空"。让你痛苦的, 往往不是你遭遇的事情本身, 而是你对这件事的"想法"和"感受"（想蕴、蕴、受蕴）。看清这些念头和感受也是来来去去的、不是坚实的, 你就你就更容易放下, 不被情绪淹没。

  - 减少执着：对于特别在意的人或物, 可以思惟"色即是空"。它们都是因缘和合的产物, 关系会变, 物品会坏。珍惜当下就好, 不必强求永远拥有, 这样可以减少很多控制和占有的痛苦。

  - 保持平和："心无挂碍"是一种极高的心境追求。在生活中, 我们可以练习对于小事不那么斤斤计较, 对于未来的不确定性不过度忧虑。事来时应对, 事过时放手, 让心灵保持更多的空间和自由。

  - 总结来说, 理解《心经》就是学习一种"减法"的智慧——减去我们强加在世界和自己身上的那些固化的标签、永恒的期待和僵硬的定义, 从而看到事物原本的、流动的、相互依存的状态。当我们这样去看待生活时, 内心的负担自然会减轻, 智慧和慈悲便会自然生起。

### 004. 洛神赋
* **第一部分：相遇**
* **原文**
  - 黄初三年, 余朝京师, 还济洛川。古人有言, 斯水之神, 名曰宓妃。感宋玉对楚王神女之事, 遂作斯赋。其辞曰：余从京域, 言归东藩。背伊阙, 越轘辕, 经通谷, 陵景山。日既西倾, 车殆马烦。尔乃税驾乎蘅皋, 秣驷乎芝田, 容与乎阳林, 流眄乎洛川。于是精移神骇, 忽焉思散。俯则未察, 仰以殊观, 睹一丽人, 于岩之畔。

* **白话文翻译**
  - 黄初三年, 我前往京都朝觐, 归来时渡过洛水。古人曾说, 这条这条河的神灵名字叫宓妃。我有感于宋玉讲的楚王遇见神女的故事, 于是写了这篇赋。文章是这样的：我从京城离开, 返回东方的封地。离开了伊阙山, 翻过了轘辕山, 走过了通谷, 登上了景山。这时太阳已经西斜, 车马都感到疲惫。于是我就在长满杜衡的河边停下车子, 在种着芝草的田野里喂马, 自己在阳林里散步, 放眼观赏洛水。就在这时, 我感到心神摇曳, 思绪涣散。低头时什么都没发现, 抬起头来, 却看到了奇异的景象：一个美丽的女子, 站在河边的岩石旁。

* **English Summary**
  - On his journey back from the capital in the year 220 AD, the poet stops by the Luo River. As he gazes upon the water, he becomes entranced and spots a stunningly beautiful woman on the bank. This marks the beginning of his encounter with the goddess.

---
* **第二部分：描绘**
* **原文**
  - 其形也, 翩若惊鸿, 婉若游龙。荣曜秋菊, 华茂春松。髣髴兮髴兮若轻云之蔽月, 飘飖兮若流风之回雪。远而望之, 皎若太阳升朝霞；迫而察之, 灼若芙蕖出渌波渌波。秾纤得衷, 修短合度。肩若削成, 腰如约素。延颈秀项, 皓质呈露。芳泽无加, 铅华弗御。云髻峨峨, 修眉联娟。丹唇外朗, 皓齿内鲜, 明眸善睐, 靥辅承辅承权。瑰姿艳逸, 仪静体闲。柔情绰态, 媚于语言。奇服旷世, 骨像应图。

* **白话文翻译**
  - 她的形态, 轻盈像受惊的鸿雁, 婉柔像水中的游龙。容光焕发胜过秋日的菊花, 体态丰态丰茂超过春天的青松。她时隐时现, 像轻云笼罩的月亮；飘荡不定, 像回旋的风卷起白雪。远远望去, 明亮得像太阳从朝霞中升起；走近细看, 鲜艳得像莲花在清波中挺立。她肥瘦适中, 高矮合度。肩膀像是人工刻削而成, 腰肢犹如一束绢帛。秀长的脖子, 露出洁白的肌肤。不需要涂抹香水香油, 也不用施加脂粉。高高的发髻, 细长的眉毛。红润的嘴唇十分鲜明, 洁白的牙齿分外夺目, 明亮的眼睛善于顾盼, 美丽的酒涡就在颊边。边。她姿态美好, 艳丽飘逸；举止文静, 体态娴雅。情态温柔宽和, 言语妩媚动人。她的服饰举世无双, 骨骼形貌仿佛画中之人。

* **English Summary**
  - The poet delivers a famous and elaborate description of the goddess's unparalleled beauty. He uses ethereal similes, comparing her to a startled swan, a swimming dragon, autumn chrysanthemums, and sunlit clouds. He details her perfect figure, flawless skin, elegant hairstyle, bright eyes, captivating smile, and her transcendent, otherworldly aura.

---
* **第三部分：爱慕与疑虑**
* **原文**
  - 余情悦其淑美兮, 心振荡而不怡。无良媒以接欢兮, 托微波而通辞。愿诚素之先达兮, 解玉佩以要之。嗟佳人之信修, 羌习礼而明诗。抗琼琯以和予兮, 指潜渊而为期。执眷眷之款实兮, 惧斯灵之我欺。感交甫之弃言兮, 怅犹豫而狐疑。收和颜而静志兮, 申礼防以自持。

* **白话文翻译**
  - 我喜爱她的贤淑美丽, 心情动荡很不平静。没有好的媒人去传达爱慕之情, 只能借助细微的水波来传递话语。我希望真挚的情意能抢先到达, 于是解下玉佩送给她定情。感叹这佳人确实美好, 她既懂礼仪又善诗文。她举起美玉来应答我, 指着深深的水府作为相约之地。我怀着眷眷的诚意, 又害怕会被这位神灵欺骗。想到郑交甫曾被神女背弃的传言, 我不禁惆怅、犹豫且疑惑。于是收起和悦的容颜, 安定心绪, 告诫自己要严守礼防。

* **English Summary**
  - The poet falls deeply in love with the goddess and offers his girdle gems as a token of his affection. She responds favorably with a gesture of her own. However, doubts creep in as he fears deception and remembers ancient tales of mortals being betrayed by spirits. He attempts to restrain his emotions and uphold propriety.

---
* **第四部分：缠绵与离别**
* **原文**
  - 于是洛灵感焉, 徙倚彷徨。神光离合, 乍阴乍阳。竦轻躯以鹤立, 若将飞而未翔。践椒涂之郁烈, 步蘅薄而流芳。超长吟以永慕兮, 声哀厉而弥长。……动无常则, 若危若安。进止难期, 若往若还。转眄流精, 光润玉颜。含辞未吐, 气若幽兰。华容婀娜, 令我忘餐。……于是越北沚, 过南冈, 纡素领, 回清阳。动朱唇以徐言, 陈交接之大纲。恨人神之道殊兮, 怨盛年之莫当。抗罗袂以掩涕兮, 泪流襟之浪浪。悼良会之永绝兮, 哀一逝而异乡。

* **白话文翻译**
  - 这时洛神受到了感动, 她低回徘徊, 身影若隐若现, 忽明忽暗。她耸起轻盈的身躯像鹤一样站立, 好像将要起飞却又未曾翱翔。走在充满浓烈香气的花椒路上, 经过杜蘅丛而散发着芳香。她怅然长吟以表达深切的爱慕, 声音悲哀、激越而又悠长。……她的行动没有固定规则, 似危险又似安全。进退难以预知, 像要离开又像要回来。她目光转动, 炯炯有神, 容颜光泽温润。话未出口, 已散发出幽兰般的香气。她那优美的姿态让我忘了吃饭。……于是她穿越北面的沙洲, 翻过南面的山岗, 回转白净的颈项, 用清亮的眼光看着我。启动朱红的嘴唇, 缓缓说道, 陈述人神交往的法则。只怨恨人神有别, 彼此无法结合；痛惜虽然同在盛年却不能如愿以偿。说着便举起罗袖掩面哭泣, 泪水不住地流下来, 沾湿了衣裳。悲伤这美好的聚会将永远断绝, 哀怨这一别就将天各一方。

* **English Summary**
  - The goddess, sensing his love and inner conflict, becomes equally distraught. They share a profound but melancholic connection. However, the fundamental barrier between gods and mortals makes a lasting union impossible. Overwhelmed with sorrow, she reveals the tragic truth: their paths cannot join. She then departs amidst a magnificent celestial procession, looking back with heartbreaking finality.

---
* **第五部分：追寻与怅惘**
* **原文**
  - 无微情以效爱兮, 献江南之明珰。虽潜处于太阴, 长寄心于君王。忽不悟其所舍, 怅神宵而蔽光。于是背下陵高, 足往神留。遗情想像, 顾望怀愁。冀灵体之复形, 御轻舟而上溯。浮长川而忘返, 思绵绵而增慕。夜耿耿而不寐, 沾繁霜而至曙。命仆夫而就驾, 吾将归乎东路。揽騑辔以抗策, 怅盘桓而不能去。

* **白话文翻译**
  - 没能用微薄的情感来表达爱意, 愿意奉献出江南的明珠耳坠。虽然我将隐居在幽冥之中, 但我的心会永远寄托在君王您的身上。忽然间我不知道她身在何处, 神女的踪影消失, 光影隐匿。于是我离开低处登上高处, 脚步虽然往前移动, 心神却仍留在原地。我留恋不舍, 回想着她的模样, 回顾张望, 满腹忧愁。期盼着神女的身影能再次出现, 我就驾着轻舟逆流而上。在漫长的洛水上行船忘了返回, 思念之情绵延不绝越来越深。夜晚心神不宁难以入睡, 身上沾满了厚厚的霜露直到天明。我命令车夫准备车马, 将要回归东方的道路。当我拿起马缰举鞭欲行之时, 却又怅然徘徊, 无法离去。

* **English Summary**
  - After her departure, the poet is consumed by longing. He tries to pursue her by boat upstream but fails. He spends a sleepless, grief-stricken night haunted by her memory. Even as he prepares to finally continue his journey, he finds himself unable to leave the place where this transcendent encounter occurred, ending the poem in a state of eternal wistfulness.

### 005. 道德经
* **第一章:**
  - 道可道, 非常道; 名可名, 非常名。无, 名天地之始; 有, 名万物之母。故常无, 欲以观其妙; 常有, 欲以观其徼。此两者, 同出而异名, 同谓之玄。玄之又玄, 众妙之门。

* **白话文:**
  - 可以用言语表述的"道", 就不是永恒的"道"; 能够被定义的"名", 就不是永恒的"名"。"无", 用来指称天地的本始; "有", 用来指称万物的根源。因此, 要常从"无"中, 去观察"道"的奥妙; 要常从"有"中, 去体会"道"的边界。"无"和"有"这两者, 来源相同而名称不同, 都可以说是幽深莫测的。幽深而又幽深, 是一切微妙变化的总门户。

* **English Translation:**
  - The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. The named is the mother of ten thousand things. Ever desireless, one can see the mystery. Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations. These two spring from the same source but differ in name. this appears as darkness. Darkness within darkness. The gate to all mystery.

* **第二章:**
  - 天下皆知美之为美, 斯恶已; 皆知善之为善, 斯不善已。 故有无相生, 难易相成, 长短相形, 高下相倾, 音声相和, 前后相随。 是以圣人处无为之事, 行不言之教。 万物作焉而不辞, 生而不有, 为而不恃, 功成而弗居。 夫唯弗居, 是以不去。

* **白话文:**
  - 天下都知道美之所以为美, 丑的观念也就产生了; 都知道善之所以为善, 不善的观念也就产生了。 所以, "有"和"无"相互依存, "难"和"易"相互促成, "长"和"短"相互显现, "高"和"下"相互依靠, "音"和"声"相互应和, "前"和"后"相互跟随。 因此, 圣人以"无为"的态度行事, 施行"不言"的教化。 让万物自行发展而不干涉, 生养万物而不据为己有, 有所作为而不自恃己能, 功业成就而不自我夸耀。 正因为不自我夸耀, 所以他的功绩才不会泯灭。

* **English Translation:**
  - When everyone in the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises. When everyone knows good as good, evil arises. Thus, existence and nonexistence generate each other, Difficulty and ease complement each other, Long and short contrast each other, High and low incline toward each other, Sound and voice harmonize with each other, Front and back follow each other. Therefore, the Sage manages affairs without action, And spreads teachings without words. All things arise, yet he claims no authority. He nurtures them, yet claims no possession. He acts, yet relies on nothing. His work is accomplished, yet he does not dwell on it. Precisely because he does not dwell on it, It never leaves him.

---
* **第三章:**
  - 不尚贤, 使民不争; 不贵难得之货, 使民不为盗; 不见可欲, 使民心不乱。 是以圣人之治, 虚其心, 实其腹, 弱其志, 强其骨。 常使民无知无欲, 使夫智者不敢为也。 为无为, 则无不治。

* **白话文:**
  - 不推崇贤才异能, 使民众不互相争斗; 不珍爱稀有贵重之物, 使民众不去偷盗; 不显耀那些能诱发贪欲的事物, 使民众的心神不被惑乱。 因此, 圣人的治理原则是：净化人民的心思, 满足人民的温饱, 减弱人民的争竞之心, 增强人民的体魄。 常常使人民没有奸诈的心智、没有贪欲, 使那些自作聪明的人不敢妄为。 以"无为"的方式去作为, 那么天下就没有不能治理的了。

* **English Translation:**
  - If you do not exalt the worthy, people will not compete. If you do not value rare treasures, people will not steal. If you do not display objects of desire, people's hearts remain undisturbed. Therefore, the Sage governs by emptying minds and filling bellies, By weakening ambitions and strengthening bones. He always keeps the people innocent of knowledge and free from desire, So that the clever ones dare not act. By acting through inaction, all things will be in order.

* **第四章:**
  - 道冲, 而用之或不盈。 渊兮, 似万物之宗。 挫其锐, 解其纷, 和其光, 同其尘。 湛兮, 似或存。 吾不知谁之子, 象帝之先。

* **白话文:**
  - 道是虚空无形的, 但它的作用却无穷无尽。 它是那样深邃啊, 仿佛是万物的本源。 它收敛锐气, 超脱纷争, 调和光芒, 混同尘世。 它是那样幽隐啊, 似无却又存在。 我不知道它由何而生, 似乎在天帝出现之前就已存在。

* **English Translation:**
  - The Way is empty, yet when used it is never exhausted. It is fathomlessly deep, seeming the ancestor of all things. It blunts sharp edges, untangles knots, softens glare, merges with dust. It is so translucent, as if barely existing. I do not know whose child it is. It seems to have existed before the Divine Ancestor.

---
* **第五章:**
  - 天地不仁, 以万物为刍狗; 圣人不仁, 以百姓为刍狗。 天地之间, 其犹橐龠乎? 虚而不屈, 动而愈出。 多言数穷, 不如守中。

* **白话文:**
  - 天地无所谓仁慈, 对待万物如同祭祀用的草狗; 圣人无所谓仁慈, 对待百姓如同祭祀用的草狗。 天地之间, 不正像一个大风箱吗? 内部空虚却不会塌陷, 越是鼓动, 风就越多。 话说太多反而容易陷入困境, 不如持守内心的虚静。

* **English Translation:**
  - Heaven and Earth are not benevolent. They treat all things as straw dogs. The Sage is not benevolent. He treats the people as straw dogs. Is not the space between Heaven and Earth like a bellows? Empty yet inexhaustible, moving ever outward. Too much talk often leads to exhaustion. Better to hold fast to the center.

* **第六章:**
  - 谷神不死, 是谓玄牝。 玄牝之门, 是谓天地根。 绵绵若存, 用之不勤。

* **白话文:**
  - 山谷般虚无的神妙作用永不消逝, 这就叫做玄秘的母性。 玄秘母体的生育之门, 就是天地的根源。 它连绵不绝地存在着, 作用是无穷无尽的。

* **English Translation:**
  - The valley spirit never dies. It is called the Mystic Feminine. The gate of the Mystic Feminine is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Continuously lingering, it seems to exist. When used, it is never exhausted.

---
* **第七章:**
  - 天长地久。 天地所以能长且久者, 以其不自生, 故能长生。 是以圣人后其身而身先, 外其身而身存。 非以其无私邪?故能成其私。

* **白话文:**
  - 天地长久存在。 天地之所以能够长久, 是因为它们的一切运作都不为自己, 所以才能长久。 因此, 圣人把自己放在最后, 反而能居于众人之先; 先; 将自己的安危置之度外, 反而能得到保全。 这不正是因为他无私吗?所以反而能成就他自己。

* **English Translation:**
  - Heaven is enduring, Earth is lasting. The reason why Heaven and Earth can endure and last Is because they do not live for themselves. Thus they can long endure. Therefore, the Sage puts himself last, yet finds himself first. Puts his own life aside, yet his life is preserved. Is it not because he is selfless? That he is able to fulfill himself.

---
* **第八章:**
  - 上善若水。水善利万物而不争, 处众人之所恶, 故几于道。居善地, 心善渊, 与善仁, 言善信, 政善治, 事善能, 动善时。夫唯不争, 故无尤。

* **白话文:**
  - 最高的善就像水一样。 水善于滋润万物而不与万物相争, 停留在众人都不喜欢的地方, 所以最接近于"道"。 居住善于选择地方, 心胸善于保持沉静, 待人善于真诚友爱, 说话善于遵守信用, 为政善于精简处理, 处事善于发挥所长, 行动善于把握时机。 只因为有不争的美德, 所以才不会招致怨咎。

* **English Translation:**
  - The highest goodness is like water. Water benefits all things without contending with them. It stays in places that people despise, therefore it is close to the Way. In dwelling, be close to the land. In meditation, go deep into the heart. In relationships, be kind and benevolent. In speech, be sincere and truthful. In governing, be just and orderly. In business, be competent and effective. In action, be timely and appropriate. It is only because there is no contention, that there is no blame.

---
* **第九章:**
  - 持而盈之, 不如其已;  揣而锐之, 不可长保。 金玉满堂, 莫之能守;  富贵而骄, 自遗其咎。 功遂身退, 天之道也。

* **白话文:**
  - 执持盈满, 不如适时停止;  显露锋芒, 锐势难以保持长久。 金玉堆满堂室, 没有人能守藏得住;  富贵而骄纵, 必定给自己留下祸患。 功业达成后懂得敛藏自身自身, 这才符合自然的规律。

* **English Translation:**
  - To hold until full is not as good as stopping in time. A blade blade over-tempered cannot long retain its edge. When gold and jade fill your hall, you cannot keep them safe. Wealth and pride bring their own ruin. When the work is done, withdraw yourself — This is the Way of Heaven.

---
* **第十章:**
  - 载营魄抱一, 能无离乎? 专气致柔, 能如婴儿乎? 涤除玄鉴, 能无疵乎? 爱民治国, 能无为乎? 天门开阖, 能为雌乎? 明白四达, 能无知乎? 生之畜之, 生而不有, 为而不恃, 长而不宰, 是谓玄德。

* **白话文:**
  - 精神和形体合而为一, 能够不分离吗? 聚结精气以致柔顺, 顺, 能达到婴儿的状态吗? 清除杂念而深入观照内心, 能没有一点瑕疵吗? 爱护人民治理国家, 能做到顺应自然吗? 感官与外境接触时, 能保持宁静吗? 通晓四方事理, 能不用心机吗? 生长万物, 养育万物, 生长而不占有, 养育而不自恃, 引导而不主宰, 这就是最深远的德。

* **English Translation:**
  - Can you keep body and soul united without separation? Can you focus your breath to become soft as a newborn babe? Can you cleanse your inner vision until it is spotless? Can you love the people and govern the state without forcing? Can you open and close the gates of nature like a female? Can you understand all yet appear unknowing? Create yet not possess, nurture yet not control— This is the Profound Virtue.

* **第十一章:**
  - 三十辐共一毂, 当其无, 有车之用。 埏埴以为器, 当其无, 有器之用。 凿户牖以为室, 当其无, 有室之用。 故有之以为利, 无之以为用。

* **白话文:**
  - 三十根辐条汇集到一个轮毂上毂上, 正是因为有了轮毂中空的地方, 才有了车的作用。 揉和黏土制作器皿, 正是因为有了器皿中空的地方, 才有了器皿的作用。 开凿门窗建造房屋, 正是因为有了门窗四壁内的空间, 才有了房屋的作用。 所以, "有"给人便利, "无"发挥了它的作用。

* **English Translation:**
  - Thirty spokes unite at one hub. It is precisely where there is nothing that the cart's usefulness lies. Knead clay to make a vessel. It is precisely where there is nothing that the vessel's usefulness lies. Cut out doors and windows to make a room. It is precisely where there is nothing that the room's usefulness lies. Therefore, "being" gives advantages, while "non-being" creates utility.

---
* **第十二章:**
  - 五色令人目盲;  五音令人耳聋;  五味令人口爽;  驰骋畋猎令人心发狂;  难得之货令人行妨。 是以圣人为腹不为目, 故去彼取此。

* **白话文:**
  - 缤纷的色彩使人眼花缭乱;  嘈杂的音调使人听觉失灵;  丰盛的食物使人舌不知味;  纵情狩猎使人心情放荡发狂;  稀有的物品诱人行为行为不轨。 因此, 圣人但求吃饱肚子而不追逐声色之娱, 所以摒弃物欲的诱惑而保持安足的生活。

* **English Translation:**
  - The five colors make one's eyes blind. The five tones make one's ears deaf. The five flavors dull one's taste. Racing and hunting madden one's mind. Rare treasures hinder one's actions. Therefore the Sage cares for the belly, not the eyes. He rejects the outer show and chooses the inner substance.

---
* **第十三章:**
  - 宠辱若惊, 贵大患若身。 何谓宠辱若惊? 宠为上, 辱为下,  得之若惊, 失之若惊,  是谓宠辱若惊。 何谓贵大患若身? 吾所以有大患者, 为吾有身,  及吾无身, 吾有何患? 故贵以身为天下, 若可寄天下;  爱以身为天下, 若可托天下。

* **白话文:**
  - 得宠和受辱都感到惊恐不安, 重视身体好像重视大的忧患一样。 什么叫宠辱若惊? 得宠是高上的, 受辱是低下的,  得到恩宠感到惊恐, 失去恩宠也感到惊恐,  这就叫宠辱若惊。 什么叫做重视大的忧患像重视自身一样? 我之所以会有大的忧患, 是因为我有这个身体,  如果我没有这个身体, 我还会有什么忧患呢? 所以, 能够以看重自身的态度去对待天下的人, 才可以把天下寄托给他;  能够以爱惜自身的态度去对待天下的人, 才可以把天下交付给他。

* **English Translation:**
  - Favor and disgrace seem alarming. Honor and great trouble concern the self as body. What means "favor and disgrace seem alarming"? Favor elevates, disgrace depresses— Gaining favor alarms us, losing favor alarms us: That is what is meant by "favor and disgrace seem alarming." What means "honor and great trouble concern the self as body"? The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. When I no longer have a body, what trouble do I have? Therefore, those who honor the world as their body may be entrusted with the world. Those who love the world as their body may be entrusted with the world.

---
* **第十四章:**
  - 视之不见名曰夷, 听之不闻名曰希, 搏之不得名曰微。此三者不可致诘, 故混而为一。其上不皦, 其下不昧, 绳绳不可名, 复归于无物。是谓无状之状, 无物之象, 是谓惚恍。迎之不见其首, 随之不见其后。执古之道, 以御今之有。能知古始, 是谓道纪。

* **白话文:**
  - 看它看不见叫作"夷", 听它听不到叫作"希", 摸它摸不着叫作"微"。这三者的形象无从究诘, 它是浑融一体的。它的上面不显得光亮, 下面也不显得阴暗, 渺茫难以形容, 回归到无形无象的状态。这叫作没有形状的形状, 不见物体的形象, 这叫作"惚恍"。迎着它, 看不见它的前头; 跟着它, 看不见它的后面。把握亘古已有的道, 用来驾驭现在的具体事物。能够了解宇宙的初始, 这就叫作道的规律。

* **English Translation:**
  - Looked at but unseen - it is called invisible. Listened to but unheard - it is called inaudible. Grasped at but untouched - it is called intangible. These three cannot be fully grasped, so they merge into one. Above it there there is no light, below it there is no darkness. Unceasing, unnameable, it returns again to nothingness. This is called the shapeless shape, the imageless image. This is called elusive and evasive. Meet it, you cannot see its face. Follow it, you cannot see its back. Hold fast to the ancient Way, to manage present existence. Thus we may know the primeval beginning - This is called the thread of the Dao.

---
* **第十五章:**
  - 古之善为士者, 微妙玄通, 深不可识。夫唯不可识, 故强为之容：豫兮若冬涉川, 犹兮若畏四邻, 俨兮其若客, 涣兮若冰之将释, 敦兮其若朴, 旷兮其若谷, 混兮其若浊。孰能浊以止?静之徐清。孰能安以久?动之徐生。保此道者不欲盈, 夫唯不盈, 故能蔽而新成。

* **白话文:**
  - 古时善于行道的人, 精妙通达, 深刻得难以认识。正因为难以认识, 只能勉强形容他：小心谨慎啊, 像冬天涉水过河; 警觉戒惕啊, 像提防四周的围攻; 拘谨严肃啊, 像在做客; 融和疏脱啊, 像冰雪消融; 敦厚朴实啊, 像未经雕琢的木材; 空旷开阔啊, 像深山的幽谷; 浑朴淳厚啊, 像浊水一样。谁能在动荡中安静下来而慢慢澄清?谁能在安定中变动起来而慢慢趋进?保持这种道的人不追求圆满, 正因他不追求圆满, 所以能够在破败中新生。

* **English Translation:**
  - The ancients skilled in the Way were subtly profound and perceptive. Too deep to be understood. Because they could not be understood, they can only be described: Cautious, like crossing a winter stream. Hesitant, like fearing neighbors on all sides. Reserved, like a guest. Yielding, like ice about to melt. Simple, like uncarved wood. Open, like a valley. Merged, like muddy water. Who can remain still until mud settles and water clears? Who can stay calm until right action occurs naturally? Those who preserve this Way do not seek fullness. Not seeking fullness, they are renewed amid decay.

* **第十六章:**
  - 致虚极, 守静笃。万物并作, 吾以观复。夫物芸芸, 各复归其根。归根曰静, 是谓复命。复命曰常, 知常曰明。不知常, 妄作凶。知常容, 容乃公, 公乃王, 王乃天, 天乃道, 道乃久, 没身不殆。

* **白话文:**
  - 达到极致的虚寂, 坚守深沉的宁静。万物都在生长发展, 我从而观察它们的循环往复。万物纷纷芸芸, 各自回归到它们的本根。回归本根就叫"静", 静叫作"复命"。复命叫作"常", 了解常叫作"明"。不了解常就会轻举妄动而导致灾祸。了解常就能包容, 包容就能公正, 公正就能周全, 周全就能符合自然, 符合自然就能符合道, 符合道就能长久, 终身不会有危险。

* **English Translation:**
  - Attain complete emptiness, maintain steadfast tranquility. While all things flourish, I watch their return. All things teeming will return to their origin. Returning to the origin is called stillness - this is returning to destiny. Returning to destiny is called constancy, knowing constancy is wisdom. Not knowing constancy leads to reckless actions and disaster. Knowing constancy brings tolerance, tolerance brings impartiality, Impartiality embraces all, embracing all makes one kingly, Kingly aligns with Heaven, Heavenly aligns with the Dao, Aligning with the Dao endures long, thus free from harm throughout life.

* **第十七章:**
  - 太上, 下知有之; 其次, 亲而誉之; 其次, 畏之; 其次, 侮之。信不足焉, 有不信焉。悠兮其贵言。功成事遂, 百姓皆谓："我自然。"

* **白话文:**
  - 最好的统治者, 人民只知道他的存在; 次一等的, 人民亲近他赞美他; 再次一等的, 人民畏惧他; 最次等的, 人民轻侮他。统治者的诚信不足不足, 人民自然不会信任他。最好的统治者是多么悠闲啊！他很少发号施令。事情办成功了, 百姓都说："我们本来就是这样。"

* **English Translation:**
Of the best rulers, people only know they exist. Next are rulers they love and praise. Then those they fear. Finally those they defy. Where integrity is lacking, trust will be withheld. How reserved they are with their words! When tasks are completed and works fulfilled, The common people say: "We did it ourselves."

---
* **第十八章:**
  - 大道废, 有仁义; 慧智出, 有大伪; 六亲不和, 有孝慈; 国家昏乱, 有忠臣。

* **白话文:**
  - 大道废弃了, 才会提倡仁义; 智巧出现了, 才会产生严重的虚伪; 家庭不和了, 才会显出孝慈; 国家混乱了, 才会产生忠臣。

* **English Translation:**
  - When the Great Way was abandoned, Benevolence and righteousness appeared. When cleverness emerged, Great hypocrisy arose. When family harmony broke down, Filial piety became praised. When the nation fell into chaos, Loyal ministers emerged.

---
* **第十九章:**
  - 绝圣弃智, 民利百倍;  绝仁弃义, 民复孝慈;  绝巧弃利, 盗贼无有。 此三者以为文不足, 故令有所属： 见素抱朴, 少思寡欲。

* **白话文:**
  - 抛弃聪明智巧, 人民可以得到百倍的好处;  抛弃仁义, 人民可以恢复孝慈的天性;  抛弃巧诈和货利, 盗贼也就没有了。 这三者作为文治法度是不够的, 所以要使人有所归属： 显现纯真, 保持质朴, 减少私心, 降低欲望。

* **English Translation:**
  - Renounce sagehood and abandon cunning, The people will benefit a hundredfold. Renounce benevolence and abandon righteousness abandon righteousness, The people will return to filial piety and compassion. Renounce skill and abandon profit, There will be no thieves or robbers. Yet these three statements are inadequate, Thus let them be connected: Embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires.

* **第二十章:**
  - 绝学无忧。唯之与阿, 相去几何?善之与恶, 相去若何?人之所畏, 不可不畏。荒兮其未央哉！众人熙熙, 如享太牢, 如春登台。我独泊兮其未兆, 如婴儿之未孩。傫傫兮傫兮若无所归。众人皆有余, 而我独若遗。我愚人之心也哉！沌沌兮。俗人昭昭, 我独昏昏。俗人察察, 我独闷闷。澹兮其若海, 飂兮若无止。众人皆有以, 而我独顽且鄙。我独异于人, 而贵食母。

* **白话文:**
  - 弃绝知识就没有忧愁。应诺和呵斥, 相差多少?美好和丑恶, 又相差多少?别人所畏惧的, 我也不能不畏惧。精神领域开阔啊, 好像没有尽头！众人都兴高采烈, 好像参加丰盛的筵席, 又像春天登上高台眺望美景。我却独自淡泊宁静啊, 没有形迹, 迹, 好像不知嬉笑的婴儿。疲倦闲散啊, 好像无家可归。众人都有多余的东西, 唯独我好象不足的样子。我真是愚人的心肠啊！混混沌沌啊！世人都光耀自炫, 唯独我暗暗昧昧的样子。世人都精明灵巧, 巧, 唯独我无所识别的样子。沉静啊, 好像大海; 飘逸啊, 好像无处停留。世人都各有作为, 唯独我愚笨而且鄙陋。我与世人不同, 而是注重汲取"道"的营养。

* **English Translation:**
  - Abandon learning and there will be no sorrow. Between "yes" and "no", how much difference? Between beautiful and ugly, how much difference? What others fear, one must also fear - how desolate! It has no end. People are joyous as if feasting on a sacrificial ox, Or climbing a terrace in spring. I alone am unmoved, showing no sign, Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. Listless, as though having nowhere to go. People all have surplus, I alone seem lacking. I have the heart of a fool - so confused! Ordinary people are bright and clear, I alone am dark and obscure. Ordinary people are alert and shrewd, I alone am dull and confused. Calm like the sea, drifting like the endless wind. People all have their purposes, I alone appear stubborn and rustic. I alone differ from others, But value drawing nourishment from the Mother.

* **第二十一章:**
  - 孔德之容, 惟道是从。道之为物, 惟恍惟惚。惚兮恍兮, 其中有象; 恍兮惚兮, 其中有物。窈兮冥兮, 其中有精; 其精甚真, 其中有信。自古及今, 其名不去, 以阅众甫。吾何以知众甫之然哉?以此。

* **白话文:**
  - 大德的样态, 完全随顺着道。道这个东西, 是恍恍惚惚的。那样的恍惚啊, 其中却有形象; 那样的恍惚啊, 其中却有实物。那样的深远暗昧啊, 其中却有精质; 那样的真实可信啊, 这其中可以得到验证。从古至今, 它的名字永远不会消失, 凭借它才能认识万物的起源。我怎么知道万物起源的情形呢?就是从道认识的。

* **English Translation:**
  - The appearance of great virtue follows only the Dao. As for the Dao, it is vague and elusive. Elusive and vague, yet within it are forms. Vague and elusive, yet within it are objects. Obscure and dim, yet within it is essence. This essence is profoundly genuine, containing truthfulness. From ancient times till now, its name remains unchanged, Through it we observe the origins of all things. How do I know the beginnings of all things? Through this.

* **第二十二章:**
  - 曲则全, 枉则直; 洼则盈, 敝则新; 少则得, 多则惑。是以圣人抱一为天下式。不自见, 故明; 不自是, 故彰; 不自伐, 故有功; 不自矜, 故长。夫唯不争, 故天下莫能与之争。古之所谓「曲则全」者, 岂虚言哉！诚全而归之。

* **白话文:**
  - 委曲反能保全, 弯曲反能伸直; 低洼反能充盈, 陈旧反能生新; 少取反能获得, 贪多反会迷惑。因此圣人持守着道作为天下的典范。不自我表现, 所以反而显明; 不自以为是, 所以反而彰显; 不自我夸耀, 所以反而有功; 不自高自大, 所以反而长久。正因为不与人争, 所以天下没有人能和他相争。古人所说的"曲则全"这些话, 难道是空话吗?确实能让人得到保全。

* **English Translation:**
  - Yield and remain whole. Bend and be straight. Be low and become filled. Wear out and become renewed. Have little and receive much. Have much and become confused. Therefore the Sage holds to the One, becoming the model for the world. Not displaying oneself, hence enlightened. Not asserting oneself, hence distinguished. Not praising oneself, hence meritorious. Not boasting, hence lasting. Just because he does not contend, no one under heaven can contend with him. The ancient saying "yield and remain whole" - are these empty words? Sincerely becoming whole, everything returns to you.

---
* **第二十三章:**
  - 希言自然。故飘风不终朝, 骤雨不终日。孰为此者?天地。天地尚不能久, 而况于人乎?故从事于道者, 同于道; 德者, 同于德; 失者, 同于失。同于道者, 道亦乐得之; 同于德者, 德亦乐得之; 同于失者, 失亦乐得之。信不足焉, 有不信焉。

* **白话文:**
  - 少发号施令是合乎自然的。狂风刮不了一个早晨, 暴雨下不了一整天。是谁造成这种情况的呢?是天地。天地的狂暴尚且都不能持久, 何况是人呢?所以从事于道的人就和道相同; 从事于德的人就和德相同; 失道失德的人就和失败相同。和道相同的人, 道也愿意和他在一起; 和德相同的人, 德也愿意和他在一起; 和失败相同的人, 失败也会伴随着他。统治者的诚信不足, 人民自然不会信任他。

* **English Translation:**
  - Sparse speech is natural. A whirlwind doesn't last all morning. A sudden rain doesn't last all day. Who causes these? Heaven and Earth. If even Heaven and Earth cannot make such things last long, How much less can human beings? Therefore those following the Dao are one with the Dao. Those practicing virtue are one with virtue. Those losing both share in loss. One with the Dao - the Dao gladly accepts him. One with virtue - virtue gladly accepts him. One sharing loss - loss gladly accompanies him. With insufficient sincerity, there will be distrust.

* **第二十四章:**
  - 企者不立, 跨者不行;  自见者不明;  自是者不彰;  自伐者无功;  自矜者不长。 其在道也, 曰余食赘行。 物或恶之, 故有道者不处。

* **白话文:**
  - 踮起脚跟的人站不稳, 迈着大步的人走不远;  自我表现的人反而不能显明;  自以为是的人反而不能彰显;  自我夸耀的人反而不能建功;  骄傲自满的人反而无法长久。 从道的角度来看来看, 这些都叫作剩饭赘瘤。 谁都厌恶它们, 所以有道的人不这样做。

* **English Translation:**
  - Those who stand on tiptoe aren't steady. Those who stride too far cannot maintain pace. Self-displayers fail to shine. Self-approvers lack distinction. Self-boasters achieve no merit. Self-exalters cannot endure. Such behaviors are to the Dao Like leftover food or tumors - All things detest them, So those with Dao do not embrace them.

* **第二十五章:**
  - 有物混成, 先天地生。 寂兮寥兮, 独立不改, 周行而不殆, 可以为天下母。 吾不知其名, 字之曰道, 强为之名曰大。 大曰逝, 逝曰远, 远曰反。 故道大, 天大, 地大, 人亦大。 域中有四大, 而人居其一焉。 人法地, 地法天, 天法道, 道法自然。

* **白话文:**
  - 有一个东西浑然一体, 在天地形成以前就已经存在。 寂静无声啊, 空虚无形啊, 它独立存在而永不改变, 循环运行而永不懈怠, 可以称为天下万物的母亲。 我不知道它的名字, 给它取名叫道, 勉强再给它起名叫大。 广大无边而周流不息息, 周流不息而伸展遥远, 伸遥远而返回本源。 所以说, 道大, 天大, 地大, 人也大。 宇宙中有四大, 而人是其中之一。 人效法地, 地效法天, 天效法道, 道效法自然。

* **English Translation:**
  - Something formed in chaos, born before Heaven and Earth. SilentSilent and void, standing alone and unchanging, Moving everywhere tirelessly everywhere tirelessly, fit to be mother of all things. I don't know its name, call it Dao, reluctantly term it Great. Great means extending everywhere, Extending means reaching far, Reaching far means returning to the source. Hence Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, Humanity is great. Four greatnesses in the cosmos, and humanity occupies one. Humanity models Earth, Earth models Heaven, Heaven models Dao, Dao models Nature.

* **第二十六章:**
  - 重为轻根, 静为躁君。 是以君子终日行不离辎重。 虽有荣观, 燕处超然。 奈何万乘之主, 而以身轻天下? 轻则失根, 躁则失君。

* **白话文:**
  - 稳重是轻率的根本, 平静是躁动的主宰。因此君子整日行走不离开载重的车辆。虽然有华丽的生活, 却能安然处之, 超然物外。为什么身为大国之君, 还要轻率躁动地治理天下呢?轻率就会丧失根本, 急躁就会丧失主导地位。

* **English Translation:**
  - Heaviness is the root of lightness. Tranquility is the master of restlessness. Therefore the noble travels all day Without parting from laden carts. Though surrounded by splendor, Remains peacefully detached. Why should a ruler of ten thousand chariots Govern lightly as if the world had no weight? Lightness loses the root, restlessness loses mastery.

* **第二十七章:**
  - 善行无辙迹, 善言无瑕谪, 善, 善数不用筹策, 善闭无关楗而不可开, 善结无绳约而不可解。是以圣人常善救人, 故无弃人; 常善救物, 故无弃物。是谓袭明。故善人者, 不善人之师; 不善人者, 善人之资。不贵其师, 不爱其资, 虽智大迷。是谓要妙。

* **白话文:**
  - 善于行走的不留痕迹, 善于言谈的没有过失, 善于计算的不用筹码, 善于关闭的不用栓梢却使人不能开, 善于捆缚的不用绳索却使人不能解。因此, 圣人总是善于挽救人, 所以没有被遗弃的人; 总是善于利用物, 所以没有被废弃的物。这就叫作内藏的明智。所以, 善人可以作为不善人的老师, 不善人可以作为善人的借鉴。如果不尊重老师, 不爱惜借鉴, 即使聪明也是大大的糊涂。这就是精深微妙的道理。

* **English Translation:**
  - Perfect walking leaves no tracks. Perfect speech incurs no faults. Perfect counting needs no counters. Perfect closing requires no bolts yet cannot be opened. Perfect binding uses no cords yet cannot be undone. Thus sages always save people, so none are abandoned. Always save things, so none are discarded. This is called concealed clarity. Thus the virtuous person becomes teacher of the flawed, The flawed person becomes resource for the virtuous. Not valuing teachers nor cherishing resources – Though seemingly wise, greatly deluded. This is called essential wonder.

* **第二十八章:**
  - 知其雄, 守其雌, 为天下溪。为天下溪, 常德不离, 复归于婴儿。知其白, 守其黑, 为天下式。为天下式, 常德不忒, 复归于无极。知其荣, 守其辱, 为天下谷。为天下谷, 常德乃足, 复归于朴。朴散则为器, 圣人用之则为官长。故大制不割。

* **白话文:**
  - 深知雄强, 却安守雌柔, 甘愿做天下的溪涧。甘愿做天下的溪涧, 永恒的德就不会离散, 而复归于婴儿般的纯真状态。深知明亮, 却安守暗昧, 成为天下的范式。成为天下的范式, 永恒的德就不会有过失, 而复归于无穷的境界。深知荣耀, 却安守卑辱, 甘愿做天下的川谷。甘愿做天下的川谷, 永恒的德才能够充足, 而复归于本初的朴素。本初的朴素分散就成了具体的器物, 圣人运用这一原则就成为百官的首领。所以完善的政治制度是不割裂的。

* **English Translation:**
  - Know masculinity, guard femininity – be the valley of the world. Being the valley of the world, constant virtue never falters, Returns to infancy. Know whiteness, guard blackness – be the model of the world. Being the model of the world, constant virtue never errs, Returns to infinite potential. Know glory, guard humility – be the gorge of the world. Being the gorge of the world, constant virtue fills completely, Returns to natural simplicity. Simplicity dispersed becomes vessels, Used by sages they become leaders. Thus great governance remains undivided.

* **第二十九章:**
  - 将欲取天下而为之, 吾见其不得已。 天下神器, 不可为也, 不可执也。 为者败之, 执者失之。 故物或行或随, 或歔或吹, 或强或羸, 或载或隳。 隳。 是以圣人去甚, 去奢, 去泰。

* **白话文:**
  - 想要夺取天下并按照自己的意志去治理, 我看他是达不到目的的。 天下是神圣的存在, 不能强行干预, 也不能把持不放不放。 强行干预的必会失败, 想把持的终将失去。 世间万物有的前行有的后随后随, 有的轻嘘有的急吹, 有的刚强有的赢弱, 弱, 有的安稳有的危殆。 因此, 圣人必须去除极端、奢侈和过度的行为。

* **English Translation:**
  - Those who wish to seize the world and control it – I see they cannot succeed. The world is a sacred vessel, Cannot be improved. Those who improve it destroy it. Those who grasp it lose it. Thus some things lead while others follow. Some breathe warm while others blow cold. Some are strong while others weak. Some rise up while others fall. Therefore the sage discards extremes, extravagance, and excess.

* **第三十章:**
  - 以道佐人主者, 不以兵强天下。 其事好还。 师之所处, 荆棘生焉。 大军之后, 必有凶年。 善者果而已, 不以取强。 果而勿矜, 勿伐, 勿骄, 不得已而用之用之, 是谓果而勿强。 物壮则老, 是谓不道, 不道早已。

* **白话文:**
  - 用道辅佐君主的人, 不靠武力逞强于天下。 用兵这件事很快就会这件事很快就会遭到报应。 军队驻扎过的地方, 荆棘丛生。 大战之后, 必定会有荒年。 善于用兵的人只要达到目的就算了, 并不用兵力来逞强。 达到目的却不自负, 不夸耀, 不骄傲, 这是迫不得已而用兵, 这就叫作达到了目的而不逞强。 事物壮盛到极点就会走向衰老, 因为这不符合道, 不符合道就会很快灭亡。

* **English Translation:**
  - One who assists the ruler with Dao Does not dominate the world with force. Use of force tends to rebound. Where armies camp, brambles grow. After great wars, years of famine follow. True skill achieves its aim then stops, Does not use force to dominate. Achieve aims without arrogance, boastfulness, or pride – Using arms only when compelled. This is achieving aims without domination. Things forced to peak soon age – This contradicts the Dao, Whatever contradicts Dao ends early.

---
* **第三十一章:**
  - 夫兵者, 不祥之器, 物或恶之, 故有道者不处。 君子居则贵左, 用兵则贵右。 兵者不祥之器, 非君子之器, 不得已而用之, 恬淡为上。 胜而不美, 而美之者是乐杀人。 夫乐杀人者, 则不可得志于天下矣。 吉事尚左, 凶事尚右。 偏将军居左, 上将军居右, 言以丧礼处之。 杀人之众, 以悲哀泣之, 战胜以丧礼处之。

* **白话文:**
  - 兵器啊, 是不吉祥的东西, 大家都厌恶它, 所以有道的人不使用它。 君子平时以左边为贵, 用兵时则以右边为贵。 兵器是不吉祥的东西, 不是君子使用的东西, 只有在不得已的时候才用它, 最好淡然处之。 胜利了也不要得意扬扬得意扬扬, 如果得意扬扬, 就是以杀人为快乐。 以杀人为快乐的人, 就不能在天下实现他的志向。 吉庆的事以左边为上, 凶丧的事以右边为上。 副将军站在左边, 上将军站在右边, 这就是说要用丧礼的仪式来处理。 战争杀伤众多, 要以悲哀的心情对待, 战胜了也要用丧礼来处理。

* **English Translation:**
  - Fine weapons are tools of misfortune. All creatures hate them, so those with Dao avoid them. Noble men value the left in peacetime, Value the right when employing force. Weapons are tools of ill omen, unfit for noble men. Use them only when unavoidable, Peaceful detachment is best. Victory is no cause for rejoicing – To rejoice is to delight in slaughter. Those who delight in slaughter Cannot attain their will in the world. Auspicious affairs favor the left, Ominous affairs favor the right. Lieutenants stand on the left, Generals on the right – Meaning funeral rites apply. Many killed in war demand mourning tears. Victory demands funeral rites.

* **第三十二章:**
  - 道常无名, 朴虽小, 天下莫能臣也。 侯王若能守之, 万物将自宾。 天地相合以降甘露, 民莫之令而自均。 始制有名, 名亦既有, 夫亦将知止, 知止可以不殆。 譬道之在天下, 犹川谷之于江海。
* **白话文:**
  - 道永远是无名而朴质的状态。虽然隐微不可见, 天下却没有谁能支配它。 侯王如果能持守它, 万物将会自然地归附。 天地间阴阳之气相合相合, 就降下甘露, 人民没有谁命令它, 它却自然均匀。 万物兴作就产生了各种名称, 名称既已产生, 就要知道适可而止, 知道适可而止就可以避免危险。 道存在于天下, 就好像江海对于川谷一样。

* **English Translation:**
  - Dao abides eternally nameless, Simple though minute, none in the world can master it. If lords and kings could guard it, All things would submit spontaneously. Heaven and Earth unite to shed sweet dew. None commands the people, yet it falls evenly across the realm. Once order emerges names arise. Names already known, better know restraint – Restraint prevents peril. Consider Dao's presence in the world: Like streams and valleys merging into rivers and seas.

---
* **第三十三章:**
  - 知人者智, 自知者明。 胜人者有力, 自胜者强。 知足者富, 强行者有志。 不失其所者久, 死而不亡者寿。

* **白话文:**
  - 了解别人的人聪明, 了解自己的人明智。 战胜别人的人有力, 克服自己的人刚强。 知道满足的人是富有的, 坚持力行的人是有志气的。 不离失根基的人能够长久, 身死而精神不朽的人才算长寿。

* **English Translation:**
  - Knowing others shows wisdom. Knowing oneself reveals enlightenment. Conquering others demonstrates others demonstrates strength. Mastering oneself shows true power. Contentment brings true wealth. Persistent effort proves determination. Never losing one's roots ensures endurance. Dying physically but perishing not – that is longevity.

---
* **第三十四章:**
  - 大道泛兮, 其可左右。 万物恃之以生而不辞, 功成不名有。 衣养万物而不为主, 常无欲, 可名于小;  万物归焉而不为主, 可名为大。 以其终不自为大, 故能成其大。

* **白话文:**
  - 大道广泛流行啊, 上下左右无所不在。 万物依赖它生长而不推辞推辞, 功业成就而不自以为有功。 护育万物而不自以为主宰, 永远没有什么欲望, 可以说它很微小; 万物都归附于它, 它却不自以为主宰, 可以说是伟大。 正因为它始终不自以为伟大, 所以才能够成就它的伟大。

* **English Translation:**
  - The great Dao floods everywhere, Flowing left and right. All things depend on it for life, yet it denies none. Accomplishes its work, yet takes no credit. Clothes and nourishes all things, yet claims no mastership – Truly it may be named insignificant. All things return to it, yet it claims no mastership – Truly it may be named great. Because it never regards itself as great, It thereby accomplishes greatness.

---
* **第三十五章:**
  - 执大象, 天下往。 往而不害, 安平太。 乐与饵, 过客止。 道之出口, 淡乎其无味。 视之不足见, 听之不足闻闻, 用之不足既。

* **白话文:**
  - 掌握了大道, 天下的人都来归往。 归往而不互相伤害, 于是大家就和平安泰。 音乐和美食, 能让过路的人停步。 而道要说出来, 却是平淡而无味的。 看它却看不见, 听它却听不到, 用它却用不完。

* **English Translation:**
  - Hold fast to the Great Image, And all under heaven will come to you. Coming without harm, settling in peace and security. Music and delicacies may detain passing guests, But words spoken of Dao seem bland and flavorless. Looking at it, it isn’t enough to be seen. Listening to it, it isn’t enough to be heard. Using it, it can never be exhausted.

---
* **第三十六章:**
  - 将欲歙之, 必固张之;  将欲弱之, 必固强之;  将欲废之, 必固兴之;  将欲夺之, 必固与之。 是谓微明。 柔弱胜刚强。 鱼不可脱于渊, 国之利器不可以示人。

* **白话文:**
  - 想要收拢它, 必先扩张它;  想要削弱它, 必先加强它;  想要废除它, 必先兴盛它;  想要夺取它, 必先给予它。 这就叫作隐蔽的征兆。 柔弱胜过刚强。 鱼不能脱离深渊深渊, 国家的有利武器不可以轻易向人展示。

* **English Translation:**
  - To shrink something, surely first expand it. To weaken something, surely first strengthen it. To abolish something, surely first promote it. To take something away, surely first give it. This is called subtle insight. Soft and weak overcome hard and strong. Fish shouldn't leave deep waters. State's powerful weapons shouldn't be displayed.

---
* **第三十七章:**
  - 道常无为而无不为。 候王若能守之, 万物将自化。 化而欲作, 吾将镇之以无名之朴。 无名之朴, 夫亦将不欲。 不欲以静, 天下将自定。

* **白话文:**
  - 道永远是顺其自然的, 然而又没有一件事不是它所作为的。 侯王如果能持守它, 万物将会自然而然地化育。 化育过程中如果有私欲发作, 我就用道的质朴来镇住它。 用道的质朴来镇住它, 那就不会有私欲了。 没有私欲就可以趋于宁静, 天下自然会安定。

* **English Translation:**
  - Dao abides eternally inactive, Yet nothing remains undone. If lords and kings could guard it, All things would transform spontaneously. Transforming, if desires stir, I'll subdue them with nameless simplicity. Nameless simplicity – truly they shall be desireless. Desireless through quietude, the world stabilizes itself.

---
* **第三十八章:**
  - 上德不德, 是以有德;  下德不失德, 是以无德。 上德无为而无以为;  下德为之而有以为。 上仁为之而无以为;  上义为之而有以为。 上礼为之而莫之应, 则攘臂而扔之。 故失道而后德, 失德而后仁, 失仁而后义, 失义而后礼。 夫礼者, 忠信之薄, 而乱之首。 前识者, 道之华, 而愚之始。 是以大丈夫处其厚, 不居其薄;  处其实, 不居其华。 故去彼取此。

* **白话文:**
  - 上德之人不刻意表现为德, 因此真正有德;  下德之人刻意表现为德, 因此实际上无德。 上德之人顺任自然而无心作为;  下德之人刻意作为而有意为之。 上仁之人有所作为却是无心而为;  上义之人有所作为并且是有意而为。 上礼之人有所作为而无人回应, 于是就扬起手臂强迫人就范。 所以失去了道然后才有德, 失去了德然后才有仁, 失去了仁然后才有义, 失去了义然后才有礼。 礼的出现, 标志着忠信的不足, 是祸乱的开始。 所谓的先知先觉, 不过是道的虚华, 是愚昧的开始。 因此, 大丈夫立身厚重, 不拘泥于浅薄;  追求内在的实质, 不迷恋表面的浮华。 所以要舍弃浅薄浮华, 采取醇厚实在。

* **English Translation:**
  - Highest virtue lacks conscious virtue, Therefore possesses virtue. Lower virtue never lets go of virtue, Therefore lacks virtue. Highest virtue takes no action, yet intends no purpose. Lower virtue takes action, intending purpose. Highest kindness takes action, yet intends no purpose. Highest justice takes action, intending purpose. Highest ritual takes action – if none respond, Roll up sleeves and enforce compliance. Thus after Dao lost came virtue, After virtue lost came kindness, After kindness lost came justice, After justice lost came ritual. Now ritual marks thinning loyalty and trust – Beginning of disorder. Foreknowledge displays Dao’s flower, Commencing folly. Therefore the noble man resides in thickness, not thinness. Resides in substance, not surface. Thus discard that and choose this.

* **第三十九章:**
  - 昔之得一者：天得一以清; 地得一以宁; 神得一以灵; 谷得一以盈; 万物得一以生; 侯王得一以为天下贞。其致之也, 谓天无以清, 将恐裂; 地无以宁, 将恐废; 神无以灵, 将恐歇; 谷无以盈, 将恐竭; 万物无以生, 将恐灭。故贵以贱为本, 高以下为基。是以侯王自称孤、寡、不穀。此非以贱为本邪?非乎?故至誉无誉。是故不欲琭琭如玉, 珞珞如石。

* **白话文:**
  - 自古以来得到"一"的： 天得到"一"而清明;  地得到"一"而安宁;  神得到"一"而灵验;  河谷得到"一"而充盈;  万物得到"一"而生长;  侯王得到"一"而使天下安定。
推而言之而言之, 天如果不能保持清明, 恐怕将要崩裂; 地如果不能保持安宁, 恐怕将要震溃; 神如果不能保持灵验, 恐怕将要消失; 河谷如果不能保持充盈, 恐怕将要枯 ; 万物如果不能生长, 恐怕将要灭绝。 所以高贵以卑贱为根本, 崇高以低下为基础。 因此侯王自称"孤"、"寡"、"不穀"。 这难道不是以卑贱为根本吗?不是吗? 所以最高的荣誉无须赞誉。 因此不愿像宝玉那样华美, 宁可如磐石般坚朴。

* **English Translation:**
  - Of old, those attaining Oneness: Heaven attained Oneness and became clear. Earth attained Oneness and became stable. Spirits attained Oneness and became divine. Valleys attained Oneness and became full. All things attained Oneness and lived. Lords attained Oneness and stabilized the world. Extending this principle: Were Heaven not clear, it might rupture. Were Earth not stable, it might collapse. Were spirits not divine, they might vanish. Were valleys not full, they might exhaust. Were all things not living, they might perish. Thus nobility takes humility as foundation. Height takes depth as base. Hence lords call themselves "orphaned," "lonely," "unworthy." Isn't this taking humility as root? Is it not? Hence ultimate honor needs no praise. Rather than glitter like jade, Better be rugged like stone.

---
* **第四十章:**
  - 反者道之动;  弱者道之用。 天下万物生于有, 有生于无。

* **白话文:**
  - 循环往复是道的运动方式;  柔弱谦下是道的运用特征。 天下万物产生于看得见的有形物质, 有形物质又产生于不可见的无形本质。

* **English Translation:**
  - Returning is Dao's movement. Weakness is Dao's function. All things under heaven arise from Being. Being arises from Non-being.

---
* **第四十一章:**
  - 上士闻道, 勤而行之;  中士闻道, 若存若亡;  下士闻道, 大笑之。 不笑不足以为道。 故建言有之： 明道若昧;  进道若退;  夷道若颣;  上德若谷;  大白若辱;  广德若不足;  建德若偷;  质真若渝;  大方无隅;  大器晚成;  大音希声;  大象无形;  道隐无名。 夫唯道, 善贷且成。

* **白话文:**
  - 上士听了道的道理, 努力实行;  中士听了道的道理, 有时想起有时忘记;  下士听了道的道理, 哈哈大笑。 不被嘲笑就不足以称为道。 所以古时候立言的人说过这样的话： 光明的道好似暗昧;  前进的道好似后退后退;  平坦的道好似崎岖;  崇高的德好似低下的山谷;  最洁白的东西好象含有污垢;  广大的德好像不足;  刚健的德好像懈怠懈怠;  质朴纯真好像浑浊;  最方正的反而没有棱角;  贵重的器物总是最后制成;  最大的声音反而听来无声;  最大的形象反而看不到形迹;  道幽隐而没有名称。 只有道, 善于辅助万物并使它完成。

* **English Translation:**
  - When superior students hear of Dao, They diligently practice it. When average students hear of Dao, They sometimes remember, sometimes forget. When inferior students hear of Dao, They laugh loudly at it. If not laughed at, it wouldn't qualify as Dao. Thus established sayings declare: Bright Dao appears dim. Advancing Dao seems retreating. Even Dao feels uneven. Higher virtue resembles a valley. Pure white seems stained. Ample virtue seems deficient. Established virtue seems furtive. Integrity pure seems sullied. Great squareness has no corners. Great talent matures slowly. Loudest sound seems silent. Greatest form has no shape. Dao hides nameless. Only Dao excels in supporting completion.

---
* **第四十二章:**
  - 道生一, 一生二, 二生三, 三生万物。 万物负阴而抱阳, 冲气以为和。 人之所恶, 唯孤、寡、不穀, 而王公以为称。 故物或损之而益, 或益之而损。 人之所教, 我亦教之： 强梁者不得其死—— 吾将以为教父。

* **白话文:**
  - 道化生出统一的整体, 统一的整体化生出阴阳二气, 阴阳二气交合而产生调和状态, 这种调和状态化生出万物。 万物背阴而向阳, 阴阳二气互相激荡而成新的和谐体。 人们所厌恶的就是"孤"、"寡"、"不穀", 但是王公却用这些词称呼自己。 所以一切事物, 减损它有时反而得到增加; 增加它有时反而受到减损。 别人教导我的, 我也用来教导他人： 强悍的人不得好死—— 我要把这句话当作教育的根本。

* **English Translation:**
  - Dao produces One. One produces Two. Two produce Three. Three produce all things. All things carry Yin yet embrace Yang, Blending Qi to create harmony. What people dislike – orphaned, lonely, unworthy – Yet kings and dukes use these terms. Thus some things lessen yet gain. Others gain yet lessen. What others teach, I likewise teach: "The violent die unnatural deaths" — This I adopt as teaching's basis.

---
* **第四十三章:**
  - 天下之至柔, 驰骋天下之至坚。 无有入无间。 吾是以知无为之有益。 不言之教, 无为之益, 天下希及之。

* **白话文:**
  - 天下最柔软的东西, 能驾御天下最坚硬的东西。 无形的力量能穿透没有间隙的东西。 我因此认识到无为的益处。 不言的教诲, 无为的好处, 天下很少有人能够做得到。

* **English Translation:**
  - Under heaven, the most yielding Gallops victoriously through the hardest. Substance-less penetrates seam-less — Hereby I know the gain of non-action. Teaching without words, benefiting without action — Few in the world reach this!

---
* **第四十四章:**
  - 名与身孰亲? 身与货孰多? 得与亡孰病? 甚爱必大费;  多藏必厚亡。 故知足不辱, 知止不殆, 可以长久。

* **白话文:**
  - 名声与生命哪一个更亲切? 生命与财货哪一个更重要? 得到名利与丧失生命哪一样更有害? 过分吝惜必定会造成更大的耗费耗费, 过多收藏必定会遭受更重的损失。 所以, 知道满足就不会受到屈辱, 知道适可而止就不会遇到危险, 这样才能长久平安。

* **English TranslationEnglish Translation:**
  - Name or life – which binds closer? Life or goods – which counts more? Gain or loss – which wounds more? Deep attachment surely incurs great cost. Amassed hoarding surely leads to heavy loss. Thus contentment avoids disgrace. Knowing limits avoids danger — This way lasts longest.

---
* **第四十五章:**
  - 大成若缺, 其用不弊。 大盈若冲, 其用不穷。 大直若屈, 大巧若拙, 大辩若讷。 静胜躁, 寒胜热。 清静为天下正。

* **白话文:**
  - 最完满的东西好似有残缺, 但它的作用永不衰竭。 最充盈的东西好似是空虚, 但它的作用无穷无尽。 最笔直的东西好似有弯曲, 最灵巧的东西好似很笨拙, 最卓越的辩才好似口齿迟钝。 冷静能克制急躁, 寒冷能克制炎热。 清静无为才能使天下安定。

* **English Translation:**
  - Great perfection seems flawed, Yet functions unimpaired. Great fullness seems empty, Yet functions endlessly. Great straightness seems bent. Great skill seems clumsy. Great eloquence seems hesitant. Calm overcomes agitation, Cold overcomes heat — Stillness sets the standard for the world.

---
* **第四十六章:**
  - 天下有道, 却走马以粪。 天下无道, 戎马生于郊。 祸莫大于不知足;  咎莫大于欲得。 故知足之足, 常足矣。

* **白话文:**
  - 当天下合乎道, 战马会被退回田间耕种;  当天下背离道, 连怀胎的母马也被征用作战。 最大的祸害莫过于不知足, 最大的罪过莫过于贪得无厌。 所以懂得满足的这种满足, 才是永远的满足。

* **English Translation:**
  - When the world follows Dao, War horses retire to fertilize fields. When the world defies Dao, War foals are bred near borders. No greater curse than discontent. No greater fault than craving gain. Thus knowing contentment knowing contentment's sufficiency — Eternal satisfaction indeed.

---
* **第四十七章:**
  - 不出户, 知天下;  不窥牖, 见天道。 其出弥远, 其知弥少。 是以圣人不行而知, 不见而明, 不为而成。

* **白话文:**
  - 不出门户, 就能够知晓天下的事理;  不望窗外窗外, 就能够认识自然的规律。 走得越远, 反而知道的越少。 所以圣人不出行而知晓情况, 不眼见而明了真相, 不作为而成就事业。

* **English Translation:**
  - Without leaving my door, I comprehend all worldly matters. Without peering through my window, I perceive celestial laws. Further one travels, Less one understands. Thus the Sage knows without journeying, Sees clearly without looking, Completes without striving.

---
* **第四十八章:**
  - 为学日益, 为道日损。 损之又损, 以至于无为。 无为而无不为。 取天下常以无事, 及其有事, 不足以取天下。

* **白话文:**
  - 求学的人, 知识一天比一天增长;  求道的人, 私欲一天比一天减少。 减少再减少, 一直到无为的境界。 顺其自然不妄为, 就没有什么事情做不成。 要想治理天下治理天下, 就要经常保持不扰民的状态。 如果总以烦苛之政扰民, 那就不配治理天下了。

* **English Translation:**
  - For learning – daily increase. For Dao – daily decrease. Decrease and decrease further, Until arriving at non-action. Act without contrivance, And nothing remains undone. Governing the world always requires non-interference. Any attempt through interference disqualifies rulership.

---
* **第四十九章:**
  - 圣人无常心, 以百姓心为心。 善者, 吾善之; 不善者, 吾亦善之; 德善。 信者, 吾信之; 不信者, 吾亦信之; 德信。 圣人在天下, 歙歙焉, 为天下浑其心, 百姓皆注其耳目, 圣人皆孩之。

* **白话文:**
  - 圣人没有固定不变的心意, 以百姓的心意为心意。 善良的人, 我善待他; 不善良的人, 我也善待他; 这样就可以使人向善。 诚实的人, 我相信他; 不诚实的人, 我也相信他; 这样就可以使人守信。 圣人立于天下, 收敛个人的意欲, 使人心思化归于浑朴, 百姓都专注于自己的耳目见闻, 圣人则把他们看作天真纯朴的孩童。

* **English Translation:**
  - The Sage maintains no fixed mind, Taking people's minds as measure: Good people – I meet with goodness. Bad people – I meet with goodness too — Thus virtue attains goodness. Trustworthy people – I trust them. Untrustworthy people – I trust them too — Thus virtue attains trustworthiness. In governing the world, the Sage gathers awareness, Blending thoughts for the public good. While people fix attention on senses, The Sage treats them as children.

  - 出生入死。 生之徒十有三;  死之徒十有三;  人之生生, 动之于死地, 亦十有三。 夫何故?以其生生之厚。 盖闻善摄生者, 陆行不遇见虎, 入军不被甲兵;  兕无所投其角, 虎无所措其爪, 兵无所容其刃。 夫何故?以其无死地。

* **白话文:**
  - 人始于生而终于死。 属于长寿的占十分之三;  属于短命的占十分之三;  本来可以活得长久但却自己走向死亡的, 也占十分之三。 为什么会这样呢?这是因为他们养生过于优厚的缘故。 据说, 善于养护自己生命的人, 在陆地上行走不会遇到犀牛和老虎, 在战争中不会被兵器所伤。 犀牛用不上它的角, 老虎用不上它的爪, 兵器用不上它的锋刃。 为什么呢?因为他身上没有可以致死的地方。

* **English Translation:**
  - Emerging means life, entering means death. Three in ten serve life's course. Three in ten serve death's path. Another three rush blindly toward fatal grounds. Why is this so? Because they clutch life too greedily. I've heard those skilled in nurturing life Walk on land without meeting rhinos tigers, Join battlefields without wearing armor weapons — Rhinos find no place for horns, Tigers find no place for claws, Soldiers find no place for blades. And why? For they occupy no place of death.

* **第五十一章:**
  - 道生之, 德畜之, 物形之, 势成之。 是以万物莫不尊道而贵德。 道之尊, 德之贵, 夫莫之命而常自然。 故道生之, 德畜之; 长之育之; 亭之毒之; 养之覆之。 生而不有, 为而不恃, 长而不宰, 是谓玄德。

* **白话文:**
  - 道生成万物, 德养育万物, 物质赋子万物形态, 环境促使万物成长。 因此万物无不尊崇道而珍贵德。 道所以受尊崇, 德所以被珍贵, 就在于它们不加以干涉而顺任自然。 所以, 道生成万物, 德养育万物; 使万物生长发育; 使万物成熟结果; 抚养保护万物。 生长万物却不据为己有, 抚育万物却不自恃己能, 导引万物而不加主宰, 这就是最深远的德。

* **English Translation:**
  - Dao generates them, Te (virtue) nurtures them, Matter shapes them, Circumstances perfect them. Thus all things revere Dao and honor Te. Dao's reverence, Te's honor — Neither commanding yet always spontaneous. Thus Dao generates, Te nurtures — Develops them, rears them, Shelters them, protects them, Produces but never owns, Acts but never presumes, Guides but never controls: This is called Mysterious Virtue.

* **第五十二章:**
  - 天下有始, 以为天下母。 既得其母, 以知其子;  既知其子, 复守其母, 没身不殆。 塞其兑, 闭其门, 终身不勤。 开其兑, 济其事, 终身不救。 见小曰明, 守柔曰强。 用其光, 复归其明, 无遗身殃, 是为袭常。

* **白话文:**
  - 天下万物都有本始, 把这本始作为天下万物的根源。 既然认识了万物的根源, 就能认识万物;  既然认识了万物, 又能持守万物的根源, 终身都没有危险。 堵塞嗜欲的孔窍, 关闭嗜欲的门径, 终身都没有劳扰的事。 打开嗜欲的孔窍, 助成他们求知逞欲的事, 就终身不可救治。 能察见细微的叫做明, 能持守柔弱的叫做强。 运用智慧的光芒, 返照内在的明澈, 不给自身带来灾殃, 这就是承袭永恒的道。

* **English Translation:**
  - Everything under heaven had a beginning, Which serves as mother to the world. Having found the mother, You thereby understand her children. Understanding the children, Return to protect the mother — Free from peril unto life's end. Block openings, shut doors — End lifelong labor. Open holes, pursue affairs — End beyond rescue. Perceiving small details – clarity. Maintaining tenderness – strength. Utilizing external light, Returning to internal brightness — Leaving no trace of calamity: This is called inheriting eternity.

* **第五十三章:**
  - 使我介然有知, 行于大道, 唯施是畏。 大道甚夷, 而人好径。 朝甚除, 田甚芜, 仓甚虚;  服文彩, 带利剑, 厌饮食, 财货有余;  是为盗夸, 非道也哉！

* **白话文:**
  - 假如我稍微有些认识, 在大道上行走, 唯一担心的是走上邪路。 大道本来很平坦, 但人们却喜欢走捷径。 宫殿非常整洁, 农田却很荒芜; 仓库十分空虚, 却穿着锦绣的衣服, 佩带着锋利的宝剑, 饱餐精美的饮食, 占有充裕的财富;  这实在是强盗式的炫耀, 绝不是道啊！

* **English Translation:**
  - Grant me slightest understanding — Walking along the great Path, My sole fear: straying off-course. Broad roads stretch smooth and wide, Yet people prefer narrow paths. Palaces gleam with polished floors, While farmlands choke with weeds, Granaries stand hollow, Yet nobles wear embroidered silks, Carry sharp swords, Feast lavishly, hoard excessive goods — This flaunts robbery's triumph! Far from Dao indeed!

---
* **第五十四章:**
  - 善建者不拔, 善抱者不脱, 子孙以祭祀不辍。 修之于身, 其德乃真; 修之于家, 其德乃余; 修之于乡, 其德乃长; 修之于邦, 其德乃丰; 修之于天下, 其德乃普。 故以身观身, 以家观察, 以乡观乡, 以邦观邦, 以天下观天下。 吾何以知天下然哉?以此。

* **白话文:**
  - 善于建立的不可拔除, 善于抱持的不会脱落, 子孙秉承此道则祭祀永不断绝。 用道来修身, 他的德就会真实; 用道来齐家, 这家人的德就会有盈余; 用道来睦邻, 这乡里的德就会增长; 用道来治国, 该国的德就会丰厚; 用道来治天下, 天下的德就会普及。 所以, 要从个人本身的角度来观察个人, 从家的角度来观察家, 从乡的角度来观察乡, 从国的角度来观察国, 从天下的角度来观察天下。 我凭什么知道天下的情况呢?就是用这种方法。

* **English TranslationEnglish Translation:**
  - Skillful builders build foundations no storm can shake. Skillful holders grip principles never slipping loose — Generation after generation sustains ancestral rites unbroken. Practice it personally – virtue manifests authentically. Practice it familially – virtue grows abundant. Practice it communally – virtue extends widely. Practice it nationally – virtue flourishes richly. Practice it universally – virtue pervades completely. Thus view individuals individually, View families familially, View villages villagelly, View states stately, View worlds universally — How do I understand universal conditions? Through this method.

* **第五十五章:**
  - 含德之厚, 比于赤子。 蜂虿虺蛇不螫, 猛兽不据, 攫鸟不搏。 骨弱筋柔而握固。 未知牝牡之合而朘作, 精之至也。 终日号而不嗄, 和之至也。 知和曰常, 知常曰明。 益生曰祥, 心使气曰强。 物壮则老, 谓之不道, 不道早已。

* **白话文:**
  - 含德深厚的人, 好比初生的婴儿。 毒虫不螫他, 猛兽不伤害他, 凶禽不搏击他。 筋骨柔弱但拳头握得很牢固。 还不知道男女交合但生殖器会自动勃起, 这是精气充足的缘故。 整天啼哭但嗓子不会沙哑, 这是和气纯厚的缘故。 认识到和谐的道理叫做恒常, 认识到恒常的道理叫做明澈。 贪图享受叫做灾殃, 意气用事叫做逞强。 事物过于强壮就会趋于衰老, 因为这不合乎道, 不合乎道就会提早死亡。

* **English TranslationEnglish Translation:**
  - One imbued with deepest virtue Compares to a newborn baby: Wasps scorpions snakes won't sting, Wild beasts won't attack, Birds of prey won't strike. Bones supple muscles tender, Yet fist clenches firm instinctively. Ignorant of sexual union, Yet organ engorges erect — Utmost essence indeed! Cries all day yet voice stays fresh — Ultimate harmony achieved! Knowing harmony – constancy. Knowing constancy – clarity. Excessive living invites omens. Passion driving energy – brute force. Creatures forced to peak soon wither — Call this counter-Dao. Counter-Dao meets early demise.

* **第五十六章:**
  - 知者不言, 言者不知。 塞其兑, 闭其门;  挫其锐, 解其纷;  和其光, 同其尘。 是谓玄同。 故不可得而亲, 不可得而疏;  不可得而利, 不可得而害;  不可得而贵, 不可得而贱。 故为天下贵。

* **白话文:**
  - 真正的智者不多说话, 到处说长论短的就不是智者。 堵住嗜欲的孔窍, 关闭嗜欲的门径;  磨掉锋芒, 化解纠纷;  含蓄光辉, 混同尘世。 这就叫做玄妙的同一境界。 所以人们无法对他亲近, 也无法对他疏远;  无法使他获利, 也无法使他受害;  无法使他尊贵, 也无法使他卑贱。 所以他被天下人所尊崇。

* **English Translation:**
  - Those who know don't speak. Those who speak don't know. Block openings, shut doors. Dull sharpness, untangle knots. Dim brilliance, blend with dust — This is called mystical unity. Thus impossible to draw him close, Equally impossible to distance. Impossible to benefit, Likewise impossible to harm. Unable to ennoble, Similarly unable to debase — Thus esteemed by all under heaven.

* **第五十七章:**
  - 以正治国, 以奇用兵, 以无事取天下。 吾何以知其然哉? 以此： 天下多忌讳, 而民弥贫;  人多利器, 国家滋昏;  人多伎巧, 奇物滋起;  法令滋彰, 盗贼多有。 故圣人云： "我无为而民自化;  我好静而民自正;  我无事而民自富;  我无欲而民自朴。"

* **白话文:**
  - 以正道治理国家, 以奇谋用兵作战, 以不扰民来赢得天下。 我怎么知道是这样的呢? 根据就在于此： 天下的禁忌越多, 人民就越贫困;  人们的利器越多, 国家就越混乱;  人们的技巧越多, 怪事就越频生;  法令越是森严, 盗贼反而更多。 所以圣人说： "我无为, 人民就自我化育;  我好静, 人民就自然端正;  我不扰民, 人民就自然富裕;  我没有贪欲, 人民就自然淳朴。"

* **English Translation:**
  - Rule the state with correctness, Employ troops with surprise tactics, Win the world through non-interference. How do I know this? Observe this evidence: More taboos imposed worldwide — Poorer people become. Sharper tools people possess — More chaotic nations grow. Cleverer skills people master — Stranger phenomena emerge. More detailed regulations enacted — More bandits multiply accordingly. Therefore the Sage declares: "I act without contriving, people transform themselves. I cherish stillness, people correct themselves. I avoid meddling, people prosper themselves. I harbor no desires, people simplify themselves."

---
* **第五十八章:**
  - 其政闷闷, 其民淳淳;  其政察察, 其民缺缺。 祸兮福之所倚, 福兮祸之所伏。 孰知其极?其无正也。 正复为奇, 善复为妖。 人之迷, 其日固久。 是以圣人方而不割, 廉而不刿, 直而不肆, 光而不耀。

* **白话文:**
  - 政治宽厚, 人民就淳朴;  政治严苛, 人民就狡黠。 灾祸啊, 幸福紧靠在它旁边; 幸福啊, 灾祸潜藏在它里面。 谁知道其中的究竟?实在没有一个定准。 正常可能变为反常, 良善可能变为妖孽。 人们的迷惑, 由来已久了。 因此, 圣人方正而不割伤人, 锐利而不刺伤人, 直率而不放肆, 光亮而不刺眼。

* **English Translation:**
  - Govern with relaxed openness — People respond with honest simplicity. Govern with tense scrutiny — People react with crafty evasion. Disaster — happiness leans against it. Happiness — disaster lurks beneath. Who discerns their ultimate pattern? Perhaps no absolute standard exists: Correct reverts to deviant, Goodness reverts to evil — Human confusion persists since ages past. Therefore the Sage: Square-edged yet never cutting sharp, Clear-cornered yet never stabbing pointed, Straightforward yet never recklessly unrestrained, Brilliant yet never glaringly dazzling.

---
* **第五十九章:**
  - 治人事天, 莫若啬。 夫唯啬, 是谓早服;  早服谓之重积德;  重积德则无不克;  无不克则莫知其极;  莫知其极, 可以有国;  有国之母, 可以长久。 是谓深根固柢, 长生久视之道。

* **白话文:**
  - 治理人民侍奉上天, 没有比俭啬更好的原则。 正因为俭啬, 可以说是及早服从自然规律;  及早服从自然规律就是在不断地积德;  不断地积德就能攻无不克;  攻无不克就无法估量他的力量;  具有无法估量的力量, 就可以担负治理国家的重任;  掌握了治理国家的根本, 就可以长治久安。 这就是根深柢固, 长生久存的道理。

* **English Translation:**
  - Managing human affairs serving cosmic law — Nothing surpasses conservation. Conservation enables early preparation. Early preparation builds abundant virtue. Abundant virtue conquers every obstacle. Every obstacle conquered reveals boundless capacity. Boundless capacity attained qualifies to govern lands. Possessing governance's mother-source enables lasting endurance — Called deeply rooted firmly grounded, Pathway sustaining prolonged vitality.

* **第六十章:**
  - 治大国若烹小鲜。 以道莅天下, 其鬼不神;  非其鬼不神, 其神不伤人;  非其神不伤人, 圣人亦不伤人。 夫两不相伤, 故德交归焉。

* **白话文:**
  - 治理大国就像烹调鲜美的小鱼。 用道来治理天下, 鬼魅也就不起作用了。 不是鬼魅不起作用, 而是它的作用不伤害人;  不但它的作用不伤害人, 圣人也不伤害人。 鬼神和圣人都不伤害人, 所以彼此之德就相互交融了。

* **English TranslationEnglish Translation:**
  - Governing large countries resembles cooking tiny fish. Approach the world with Dao — Ghosts lose supernatural powers. Not that ghosts lack power — Their power simply doesn't harm humans. Since neither side inflicts harm, Mutual virtues converge together.

---
* **第六十一章:**
  - 大邦者下流, 天下之牝, 天下之交也。 牝常以静胜牡, 以静为下。 故大邦以下小邦, 则取小邦;  小邦以下大邦, 则取大邦。 故或下以取, 或下而取。 大邦不过欲兼畜人, 小邦不过欲入事人。 夫两者各得所欲, 大者宜为下。

* **白话文:**
  - 大国要像江河的下游一样, 处于天下雌柔的位置, 那是天下交汇的地方。 雌柔常以静定胜过雄强, 因为静定处在下方。 所以大国对小国谦下, 就可取得小国的信赖;  小国对大国谦下, 就可被大国所容纳。 所以或者因谦下而取得信赖, 或者因谦下而被容纳。 大国不过是想兼并领导小国, 小国不过是想依附侍奉大国。 这样两方面都能满足愿望, 大国尤其应该谦下。

* **English Translation:**
  - Large countries resemble lower river reaches — Feminine position under heaven, Intersection point of all currents. The feminine constantly conquers masculine through stillness, Making stillness the foundation. Thus when large countries humble themselves before small ones, They win the small countries' allegiance. When small countries humble themselves before large ones, They gain acceptance from large countries. Either humbling gains, or being humbled obtains. Large countries merely want to shelter others, Small countries just wish to join larger realms — Both sides obtain their desires, But the greater ought to maintain humility.

* **第六十二章:**
  - 道者万物之奥, 善人之宝, 不善人之所保。 美言可以市尊, 美行可以加人。 人之不善, 何弃之有? 故立天子, 置三公, 虽有拱璧以先驷马, 不如坐进此道。 古之所以贵此道者何? 不曰：求以得, 有罪以免邪? 故为天下贵。

* **白话文:**
  - 道是万物的庇荫, 是善人的珍宝, 也是不善人的保障。 美好的言辞可以博取尊敬, 良好的行为可以被人推崇。 人有不善, 为什么要抛弃他呢? 所以在天子即位、设置三公的时候, 虽然有拱璧在先、驷马在后这样隆重的献礼仪式, 还不如用道来作为献礼。 古时候为什么贵重这个道呢? 不是说：有求即能得到, 有罪即可免除吗? 所以就成为了天下最尊贵的。

* **English Translation:**
  - Dao provides refuge for all things — Treasure to the good, Protection to the bad. Fair words earn respect. Decent conduct wins followers. When people behave badly, Why reject them utterly? Establish Son of Heaven, Appoint three senior dukes — Present jade discs precede four-horse chariots — Better sit quietly advancing in this Way. Ancient worthies treasured this Dao — why? Didn't they say: "Seek and obtain, Have sins forgiven freely?" Thus honored above all under heaven.

* **第六十三章:**
  - 为无为, 事无事, 味无味。 大小多少, 报怨以德。 图难于其易, 为大于其细。 天下难事, 必作于易;  天下大事, 必作于细。 是以圣人终不为大, 故能成其大。 夫轻诺必寡信, 多易必多难。 是以圣人犹难之, 故终无难矣。

* **白话文:**
  - 以"无为"的态度去作为, 以"不生事"的方式去做事, 以"恬淡无味"当作有味。 大生于小, 多起于少, 用德行回报怨恨。 处理困难要在它还容易的时候着手, 实现远大目标要从细微之处做起。 天下的难事, 一定从简易的地方做起;  天下的大事, 一定从细小的地方开始。 所以圣人始终不做大事, 因此才能成就大事。 那些轻易许诺的一定很少兑现承诺, 把事情看得太容易一定会遭遇很多困难。 所以圣人遇事总是看得困难些, 因此最终就没有困难了。

* **English Translation:**
  - Act through non-action, Work through non-interference, Taste the tasteless. Treat small as big, few as many — Repay injury with virtue. Plan difficult tasks during easy stages. Achieve great deeds starting small steps. World's hardships necessarily begin easily. World's major accomplishments start minutely. Thus the Sage never attempts grandiose schemes, Therefore accomplishes greatness. Casual promises invite broken trust. Assuming ease guarantees hardship. Therefore the Sage anticipates difficulties, Hence ultimately encounters no difficulty.

---
* **第六十四章:**
  - 其安易持, 其未兆易谋, 其脆易泮, 其微易散。 为之于未有, 治之于未乱。 合抱之木, 生于毫末;  九层之台, 起于累土;  千里之行, 始于足下。 为者败之, 执者失之。 是以圣人无为故无败, 无执故无失。 民之从事, 常于几成而败之。 慎终如始, 则无败事。 是以圣人欲不欲, 不贵难得之货;  学不学, 复众人之所过。 以辅万物之自然, 而不敢为。

* **白话文:**
  - 局面安定时容易维持, 事变没有迹象时容易图谋, 事物脆弱时容易消解, 事物微细时容易散失。 要在事情还没有发生时就处理好, 要在祸乱还没有产生时就控制住。 合抱的大树, 由细小的萌芽长成;  九层的高台, 从一堆泥土筑起;  千里的远行, 从脚下第一步开始。 强作妄为的必将失败, 执着把持的必将丧失。 因此圣人无所作为所以也不会招致失败, 无所执着所以也不会遭受损失。 人们做事, 总是在快要成功时失败。 如果在事情结束时还能像开始时那样慎重, 就不会有失败的事情了。 因此圣人把没有欲望当作欲望, 不珍视难得的货物;  学习别人所不学的道理, 挽回众人的过错。 以此来辅助万物自然发展, 而不敢妄为。

* **English Translation:**
  - Stability maintains easily, Latency plans readily, Frailty dissolves smoothly, Minuteness disperses effortlessly. Handle matters before they arise. Bring order before confusion starts. Enormous trees sprout from slender shoots. Nine-story towers rise from piled earth. Thousand-mile journeys begin beneath feet. Forceful action courts defeat. Tenacious grasping ensures loss. Thus the Sage acts not therefore fails not, Grasps not therefore loses not. People undertaking tasks often fail nearing success. Carefully conclude as commencing — no failed undertakings. Thus the Sage wants what others don't want, Values not rare precious goods. Learns what others ignore, Rectifying collective errors. Supporting all things' natural development, Never daring forceful intervention.

* **第六十五章:**
  - 古之善为道者, 非以明民, 将以愚之。 民之难治, 以其智多。 故以智治国, 国之贼;  不以智治国, 国之福。 知此两者亦稽式。 常知稽式, 是谓玄德。 玄德深矣, 远矣, 与物反矣, 然后乃至大顺。

* **白话文:**
  - 古代善于行道的人, 不是教导人民知晓智巧伪诈, 而是使人民淳朴敦厚。 人民之所以难于统治, 是因为他们使用了太多的智巧心机。 所以用智巧去治理国家, 是国家的灾害;  不用智巧去治理国家, 是国家的福祉。 要知道这两种治国方式的差别也就是一种法则。 经常认识这个法则, 就是深远的德。 深远的德是那样的深奥、辽远, 与一般的事物似乎相反, 然而只有这样才能够达到最大程度的和顺。

* **English Translation:**
  - Ancients skilled in practicing Dao Didn't enlighten people with cunning, Instead returned them to simple honesty. People prove difficult governing difficult governing because They employ excessive intellect scheming. Hence using intelligence rules harms nations. Eschewing intelligence blesses nations. Recognizing these two approaches constitutes guiding principle. Constant recognition of this principle defines mysterious virtue. Profound virtue runs deep stretches distant, Contrary to ordinary ways — Ultimately leading towards supreme harmony.

* **第六十六章:**
  - 江海所以能为百谷王者, 以其善下之, 故能为百谷王。 是以圣人欲上民, 必以言下之;  欲先民, 必以身后之。 是以圣人处上而民不重, 处前而民不害。 是以天下乐推而不厌。 以其不争, 故天下莫能与之争。

* **白话文:**
  - 江海之所以能成为千百河谷的统帅, 是因为它善于处在低下的位置, 所以能成为千百河谷的统帅。 因此, 圣人要居于人民之上, 就必须用言语表示谦下; 要居于人民之前, 就必须把自己放在后面。 所以圣人居于上位而人民不感到负担, 居于前面而人民不感到妨害。 因此, 天下人都乐意拥戴他而不厌弃。 正是因为他不与人争, 所以天下没有人能和他相争。

* **English Translation:**
  - Rivers and seas reign over all valley streams Because they excel at staying lower — Thus command all valley streams. Therefore wishing to stand above people, Must speak humbly beneath them. Wishing to lead among people, Must position self behind them. Thus the Sage dwells above yet none feel burdened, Leads ahead yet none feel obstructed. Thus everyone gladly supports without resentment. Precisely because contending none contends successfully.

---
* **第六十七章:**
  - 天下皆谓我道大, 似不肖。 夫唯大, 故似不肖。 若肖, 久矣其细也夫！ 我有三宝, 持而保之。 一曰慈, 二曰俭, 三曰不敢为天下先。 慈故能勇; 俭故能广; 不敢为天下先, 故能成器长。 今舍慈且勇, 舍俭且广, 舍后且先, 死矣！ 夫慈, 以战则胜, 以守则固。 天将救之, 以慈卫之。

* **白话文:**
  - 天下人都说我讲的"道"太大了, 似乎什么都不像。 正因为它太大了, 所以才不像任何具体事物。 如果它像什么具体事物, 早就变得渺小了！ 我有三件法宝, 一直掌握并保持着。 第一件叫慈爱, 第二件叫节俭, 第三件叫不敢居于天下人的前面。 因为有慈爱, 所以能勇敢; 因为有节俭, 所以能宽广; 因为不敢居于天下人的前面, 所以能成为万物的首长。 现在丢弃了慈爱而只讲勇武, 丢弃了节俭而只求宽广, 丢弃退让而只求争先, 结果是死路一条！ 有了慈爱之心, 用于征战就能获胜, 用于守卫就能稳固。 上天要救助一个人, 就用慈爱之心来护卫他。

* **English Translation:**
  - Everyone says my Dao vast, Unlike anything particular. Its very immensity explains dissimilarity — Resemblance would imply insignificance long ago! I hold three treasures guarding closely: First called compassion, Second called frugality, Third called dare-not-lead-the-world. Compassionate therefore courageous. Frugal therefore ample. Dare-not-lead therefore effective leadership. Today abandoning compassion pursuing courage, Discarding frugality chasing expansion, Forsaking deference vying for precedence — That way lies certain doom! Compassion used in warfare assures victory, Used in defense secures stability. Heaven saves whom it will, Using compassion protecting them.

---
* **第六十八章:**
  - 善为士者不武, 善战者不怒, 善胜敌者不与, 善用人者为之下。是谓不争之德, 是谓用人之力, 是谓配天古之极。

* **白话文:**
  - 善于做将帅的人不崇尚勇武;  善于打仗的人不容易被激怒;  善于胜敌的人不与敌人正面冲突;  善于用人的人对人谦下。 这就叫作不与人争的德行, 这就叫作运用别人的能力, 这就叫作符合自然的最高准则。

* **English Translation:**
  - Skilled commanders avoid militarism. Expert warriors resist rage. Superior conquerors engage not directly. Effective employers position themselves beneath workers — This signifies virtue without contention, Demonstrates utilizing others' strengths, Matches nature's highest excellence.


---
* **第六十九章:**
  - 用兵有言："吾不敢为主而为客, 不敢进寸而退尺。" 是谓行无行, 攘无臂, 扔无敌, 执无兵。 祸莫大于轻敌, 轻敌几丧吾宝。 故抗兵相加, 哀者胜矣。

* **白话文:**
  - 用兵的人曾这样说："我不敢主动进攻而要采取守势, 不敢前进一寸而要后退一尺。" 这就如同行军却没有阵势, 奋臂却没有举动, 对抗却没有敌人, 持握却没有兵器。 祸患没有再比轻敌更大的了, 轻敌几乎丧失了我的法宝。 所以两军相对峙时, 悲愤的一方可以获得胜利。

* **English Translation:**
  - Military strategists advise: "I dare not play host acting aggressively, Rather assume guest role defensively. Dare-not advance inch rather retreat foot." Means marching formationless, Arm-stretching motionless, Engaging opponentless, Gripping weaponless. No disaster exceeds underestimating enemies — Nearly costing my treasures. Thus confronting armies matched equally, The grieving side prevails ultimately.

* **第七十章:**
  - 吾言甚易知, 甚易行。 天下莫能知, 莫能行。 言有宗, 事有君。 夫唯无知, 是以不我知。 知我者希, 则我者贵。 是以圣人被褐怀玉。

* **白话文:**
  - 我的话很容易理解, 也很容易实行。 可是天下竟没有人能理解, 没有人能实行。 言论有主旨, 行事有依据。 正是由于人们无知, 所以他们不理解我。 理解我的人稀少, 效法我的人可贵。 因此, 圣人外面穿着粗布衣服, 怀里揣着宝玉。

* **English Translation:**
  - My teachings extremely easy understand, Extremely easy practice. Yet nobody understands practices them. Words possess ancestry, Actions contain sovereignty. Simply due ignorance nobody recognizes me. Those recognizing me remain rare, Those emulating me become precious. Therefore the Sage wears coarse cloth concealing jade inside.

---
* **第七十一章:**
  - 知不知, 上;  不知知, 病。 夫唯病病, 是以不病。 聖人不病, 以其病病, 是以不病。

* **白话文:**
  - 知道自己还有所不知道, 这是很高明的;  不知道却自以为知道, 这就是缺点。 正因为把缺点当作缺点, 所以才会没有缺点。 圣人没有缺点, 是由于他把缺点当作缺点来对待, 所以他没有缺点。

* **English Translation:**
  - To know you don't know — highest. Not to know you know — flaw. Only by recognizing flaws as flaws, Can one exist flawless. The Sage remains flawless precisely because He acknowledges flaws existing — Thus remaining free from defects.

* **第七十二章:**
  - 民不畏威, 則大威至。 無狎其所居, 無厭其所生。 夫唯不厭, 是以不厭。 是以聖人自知不自見, 自愛不自貴。 故去彼取此。

* **白话文:**
  - 当人民不再畏惧统治者的威严时, 那么更大的威胁（指反抗）就要来临了。 不要逼迫人民不得安居, 不要阻塞人民的生计。 只有不压迫人民, 才不会遭人民厌弃。 因此, 圣人但求自知而不自我表扬, 但求自爱而不自居高贵。 所以要舍弃后者而采取前者。

* **English Translation:**
  - When people cease fearing authority, Then great upheaval arrives. Don't confine where they dwell, Don't despise how they live. By not despising others, Avoid being despised ourselves. Thus the Sage knows himself without self-display, Cherishes himself without self-glorification. Thus rejecting that choosing this.

* **第七十三章:**
  - 勇于敢则杀, 勇于不敢则活。 此两者, 或利或害。 天之所恶, 孰知其故? 是以圣人犹难之。 天之道, 不争而善胜, 不言而善应, 不召而自来, 繟然而善谋。 天网恢恢, 疏而不失。

* **白话文:**
  - 勇气用在逞强好斗上就会遭到杀戮, 勇气用在谨慎柔和上就能生存。 这两种勇气的结果, 一个得利一个受害。 上天所厌恶的, 谁知道是什么缘故呢? 所以圣人也难以说得清楚。 自然的规律是：不争斗而善于取胜, 不说话而善于回应, 不召唤而自动到来, 坦然而善于谋划。 天道的作用范围广阔无边, 虽然稀疏却没有任何漏失。

* **English Translation:**
  - Courage channeled audacity invites execution, Courage expressed caution preserves life. These two outcomes bring benefit harm respectively. Whom Heaven dislikes — who knows reason why? Even Sages hesitate explaining. Nature's way contends not yet masters winning, Speaks not yet answers perfectly, Summons not yet arrives spontaneously, Serene yet excellent planning. Heaven's net cast wide immense, Meshes sparse yet misses nothing.

* **第七十四章:**
  - 民不畏死, 奈何以死惧之? 若使民常畏死, 而为奇者, 吾得执而杀之, 孰敢? 常有司杀者杀。 夫代司杀者杀, 是谓代大匠斲。 夫代大匠斲, 希有不伤其手矣。

* **白话文:**
  - 如果人民不害怕死亡, 那么用死刑来威慑他们又有什么用呢? 如果要让人民真的惧怕死亡, 那么对于那些为非作歹的人, 我们可以抓来杀掉, 谁还敢再做坏事呢? 通常有专管杀人的人去执行杀的任务。 代替专管杀人的人去杀人, 就如同代替高明的木匠去砍木头。 代替高明的木匠砍木头, 很少有不砍伤自己手的。

* **English Translation:**
  - When people stop fearing death, Why threaten executing them? Supposing people normally feared dying, Capturing executing wrongdoers — Then who'd dare misbehave? Constantly designated executioners execute. Attempting replace official executioners Equals replacing master carpenter chopping wood — Seldom escapes injuring own hand!

* **第七十五章:**
  - 民之饥, 以其上食税之多, 是以饥。 民之难治, 以其上之有为, 是以难治。 民之轻死, 以其上求生之厚, 是以轻死。 夫唯无以生为者, 是贤于贵生。

* **白话文:**
  - 人民之所以饥饿, 是因为统治者吞食的赋税太多, 所以才陷于饥饿。 人民之所以难以统治, 是因为统治者恣意妄为, 所以才难以统治。 人民之所以轻视死亡, 是因为统治者奉养太过丰厚, 所以才不怕死。 只有那些不把生命看得太重的人, 比起过分重视生命的人来说更为高明。

* **English Translation:**
  - Peoples' hunger stems from rulers consuming excessive taxes — Thus starvation occurs. Peoples' resistance governing originates From rulers' excessive activity — Thus resisting governance. Peoples' disregarding death derives From superiors excessively clinging life — Thus holding death cheaply. Indeed valuing nothing compared living existence, Surpasses glorifying mere survival.

* **第七十六章:**
  - 人之生也柔弱, 其死也坚强。 萬物草木之生也柔脆, 其死也枯槁。 故堅強者死之徒, 柔弱者生之徒。 是以兵強則滅, 木強則折。 強大處下, 柔弱處上。

* **白话文:**
  - 人活着的时候身体是柔软的, 死了以后就变得僵硬。 万物草木生长的时候是柔韧脆弱的, 死了以后就变得干枯坚硬。 所以, 坚强的东西属于死亡的一类, 柔弱的东西属于生存的一类。 因此, 用兵逞强就会遭到灭亡, 树木强大就会被摧折。 强大的处于下降之位, 柔弱的处于上升之位。

* **English Translation:**
  - Humans soft supple alive, Turn rigid stiff dead. Plants herbs pliable vibrant growing, Become brittle withered deceased. Thus rigid hardness belongs death's companions, Soft weakness belongs life's partners. Hence military might invites destruction, Wood overly hard invites snapping. Strength rigidity occupies lower positions, Yielding flexibility occupies higher places.

* **第七十七章:**
  - 天之道, 其猶張弓與? 高者抑之, 下者舉之;  有餘者損之, 不足者補之。 天之道, 損有餘而補不足。 人之道, 則不然, 損不足以奉有餘。 孰能有餘以奉天下?唯有道者。 是以聖人為而不恃, 功成而不處, 其不欲見賢。

* **白话文:**
  - 自然的规律, 岂不是很像拉开弓弦一样吗? 高了就把它压低, 低了就把它抬高;  过满了就把它减少, 不够满就把它补足。 自然的规律, 是减少有余的, 补给不足的。 人间的规则却不是这样, 是剥夺不足的, 用来供奉有余的。 谁能够把多余的拿来供给天下人呢?只有得道的人。 因此, 圣人有所作为而不自恃己能, 有所成就而不居功, 他不想显示自己的贤能。

* **English Translation:**
  - Heaven's way resembles bending bow: High part presses downward, Low part lifts upward. Excess portion reduces, Deficient portion supplements. Nature's way reduces surplus aiding need. Human ways differ thus — Reduce lacking serving wealthy. Who can offer abundance serving world? Only possessors Dao. Thus Sages act claiming possession not, Succeed occupying achievement not, Desiring display superiority display superiority not.

* **第七十八章:**
  - 天下莫柔弱於水, 而攻堅強者莫之能勝, 以其無以易之。 弱之勝強, 柔之勝剛, 天下莫不知, 莫能行。 是以聖人云：「受國之垢, 是謂社稷主; 受國之不祥, 是為天下王。」 正言若反。

* **白话文:**
  - 天下没有什么东西比水更柔弱了, 然而攻击坚强的东西, 却没有什么能胜过水的, 因为它是无法被替代的。 弱小能战胜强大, 温柔能战胜刚硬, 天下没有人不懂, 却又没有人能做做到。 所以圣人说：「承担全国的屈辱, 才算得上是国家的君主; 承担全国的祸难, 才能当天下的君王。」 正当的话听起来像是反话。

* **English Translation:**
  - Nothing under heaven softer weaker water, Yet attacking solid strongest nothing beats water — Because nothing substitutes possible. Water triumphs rock, Gentleness defeats toughness — All recognize truth none implement fully. Thus Sage declares: "Accept kingdom's shame — titled altar's lord. Bear nation's misfortunes — crowned world's king." Truthful statements sound paradoxical.

---
* **第七十九章:**
  - 和大怨, 必有餘怨; 報怨以德, 安可以為善? 是以聖人執左契, 而不責於人。 有德司契, 無德司徹。 天道無親, 常與善人。

* **白话文:**
  - 和解深重的仇怨, 必然还会留下残余的仇怨; 用德来报答仇怨, 这怎么可以算是妥善的办法呢? 因此, 圣人保存借据的存根, 但并不据此索取偿还。 所以有德的人就像持有借据的人那样宽容, 没有德的人就像掌管税收的人那样苛刻。 自然的规律是没有偏爱的, 却常常帮助善人。

* **English Translation:**
  - Reconciling bitter enmities inevitably leaves lingering resentments. Requite injuries virtue — can considered adequate solution? Therefor Sage holds receipt copy demanding payment nobody. Virtuous manage tallies record-keeping, Virtueless exact levies tax-collecting. Heaven's impartial favors none, Constantly accompanies kindhearted persons.

---
* **第八十章:**
  - 小國寡民。使有什伯之器而不用; 使民重死而不遠徙。雖有舟輿, 無所乘之; 雖有甲兵, 無所陳之。使民復結繩而用之。甘其食, 美其服, 安其居, 樂其俗。鄰國相望, 雞犬之聲相聞, 民至老死, 不相往來。

* **白话文:**
  - 使国家变小, 使人民稀少。 即使有效率十倍百倍的工具器械也并不使用;  使人民看重生命而不冒险迁徙远方。 虽然有船只车辆, 却没有必要乘坐;  虽然有铠甲兵器, 却没有机会陈列。 使人民回复到结绳记事的时代。 人民吃得香甜, 穿得漂亮, 住得安適, 滿意於他們的風俗習慣。 邻近的国家互相望得见, 鸡鸣狗吠的声音互相听得见, 但人民直到老死, 也不互相往来。

* **English Translation:**
  - Small state sparsely populated. Ensure advanced tools hundredfold efficiency unused. Make people regard death gravely hence migrate distantly rarely. Although boats carriages available, No necessity riding them. Although armored soldiers weapons prepared, No occasion deploying occasion deploying them. Let people revert knotted cord recording methods. Relish foods whatever eaten, Admire clothes whatever worn, Content dwellings wherever lived, Delighted customs however practiced. Neighboring states visible each other, Cocks crowing dogs barking audible mutually — Citizens until aged dying, Do not interact reciprocally.

---
* **第八十一章:**
  - 信言不美, 美言不信。 善者不辯, 辯者不善。 知者不博, 博者不知。 聖人不積, 既以為人己愈有, 既以與人己愈多。 天之道, 利而不害; 聖人之道, 為而不爭。

* **白话文:**
  - 真实的言辞不华美, 华美的言辞不真实。 善良的人不巧辩, 巧辩的人不善良。 真正懂的人不卖弄广博, 卖弄广博的人不是真懂。 圣人没有私蓄, 尽力帮助别人, 自己反而更充足; 尽力给予别人, 自己反而更丰富。 自然的规律, 是利物而不害物; 圣人的准则, 是施为而不争夺。

* **English TranslationEnglish Translation:**
  - Honest words appear unadorned, Ornamented words prove insincere. Good people argue contentiously not, Argumentative people demonstrate goodness not. Knowledgeable display erudition not, Erudite pretenders reveal knowledge not. Sages accumulate possessions not — Wholeheartedly assisting others enriches self more. Completely giving others multiplies own abundance. Way Heaven benefits harming nothing. Way Sages acts competing never.
