* **寻常歌**

書致故鄉人 十二年春已過
→ Writing a letter to those back home — twelve springs have already passed.

萬事逐流去 也順遂也蹉跎
→ All things drift with the current — some go smoothly, some are wasted in delay.

路比歲月長 心事更無從說
→ The road is longer than the years, and the thoughts in my heart have nowhere to be told.

鐘聲夕陽外 落筆竟無措
→ Beyond the evening bell and setting sun, my pen falls, yet I am at a loss.

只敢問春風如何
→ I only dare to ask the spring wind how it fares.

昨夜夢回中 推窗見小村落
→ Last night, returning in a dream, I opened the window and saw a small village.

童言說無忌 擁身坐看天河
→ Children spoke without restraint; I held myself close and sat watching the Milky Way.

枯榮青草地 故人音容在側
→ On grasslands of withering and blooming alike, old friends’ voices and faces were beside me.

落木蕭蕭下 合眼見神佛
→ Amid rustling falling leaves, I closed my eyes and saw gods and Buddhas.

痛快痛恨都照徹
→ Joy and hatred alike were laid bare.

桃花都吹落 春秋都吹落
→ Peach blossoms are all blown away; so too are spring and autumn.

最懂竟是夢中那一刻
→ What understands me best is that single moment in the dream.

長生長漂泊 復醒復作客
→ A long life, a long drifting — waking again, I am once more a guest.

年頭年尾各自活
→ At the year’s beginning and end, each lives on their own.

遍地又如何 春光又如何
→ What if the land is everywhere? What if the spring light is abundant?

紛紛求不得
→ So many things are sought, yet never obtained.

所幸不過是 尋常人間事
→ Fortunately, they are nothing more than ordinary human affairs.

作首尋常歌
→ So I write an ordinary song.

如今太平世 繁華裡空消磨
→ Now in an age of peace, time is idly worn away amid prosperity.

說到頭還是 舊紅塵看不破
→ In the end, the old worldly dust is still seen through imperfectly.

風雨伸手遮 永別如何捱過
→ If wind and rain can be blocked by a raised hand, how does one endure eternal farewell?

走馬去蘭台 燈火連天闊
→ Riding past toward the Orchid Terrace, lights stretch endlessly beneath the sky.

看不見悲歡離合
→ No sorrow or joy, no parting or reunion can be seen.

桃花都吹落 春秋都吹落
→ Peach blossoms fall away; spring and autumn fall away.

最懂竟是夢中那一刻
→ The one that understands most is that moment within the dream.

長生長漂泊 復醒復作客
→ A long life, long wandering — waking again, I remain a traveler.

年頭年尾各自活
→ At year’s start and end, each survives on their own.

遍地又如何 春光又如何
→ What if it spreads everywhere? What if spring shines brightly?

紛紛求不得
→ Still, all is sought in vain.

所幸不過是 尋常人間事
→ Luckily, they are merely ordinary matters of the human world.

作首尋常歌
→ Thus, an ordinary song is written.

也只能懂得 永不會懂得
→ One can only understand — and yet never truly understand.

流離失所卻不動聲色
→ Displaced and wandering, yet showing no emotion.

所以多少人 滿堂歡聲裡
→ So many people, amid halls full of laughter,

凝望著酒杯沈默
→ Stare into their wine cups in silence.

遍地又如何 春光又如何
→ What if the land is full? What if spring is bright?

紛紛求不得
→ Still, none of it can be attained.

所幸不過是 尋常人間事
→ Thankfully, they are only ordinary human affairs.

作首尋常歌
→ And so, an ordinary song is sung.
